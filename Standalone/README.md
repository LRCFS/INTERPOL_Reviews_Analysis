# INTERPOL Reviews Analysis - Standalone

## International Forensic Science Managers Symposium References Analysis Tool 

The use of forensic evidence has become indispensable in many countries and jurisdictions around the world, however the dissemination of research advancements does not necessarily directly or easily reach the forensic science community.

The R-Shiny app provides an analysis of references lists available in the INTERPOL reports with an export functionality of searched records. 

## Using the Standalone Code

This code was developed using Rstudio 1.4.1106, R 4.0.4 and uses Renv for package management.

To get started, open `INTERPOL_Reviews_Analysis.Rproj` in RStudio, this is to ensure the working directory is set correctly and that the renv package management dependencies are loaded. Next run the following command to install the required dependencies: `renv::restore()`

Each code can be run individually to provide a series of specific output for all the available input data.

The code are labeled according to the figure position in the paper. Additional code is also provided for keywords and affiliation analysis. 

The reference lists (input data in CSV format) are located in the INTERPOL and Scopus folders

The output figures and tables generated by the code are saved in the `Results` folder.
