These identifications are based on striae located on the bearing surface of the wads as a result of burrs left behind by the tool used to cut the barrel. This study evaluates the reproducibility and individuality of these striations through the microscopic examination of plastic wads fired from a shotgun after a hacksaw has been used to cut off portions of the barrel. Methods for testing, microscopic examination, and documentation were developed that may aid examiners when faced with such evidence in future casework.","Examination of Plastic Wads, Hacksaw Blades, Lighting Methods, Sawed-off Shotgun, Winchester Drylok Super Steel Ammunition",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2004,Firearms,Firearms

In the beginning, when the semi-automatic versions were first put on the market, the fire control parts (bolt carrier, hammer, disconnector, trigger and selector) were just slightly modified or in some cases not changed at all for semi-automatic fire only. In this study I will examine more than five generations of fire control components of both selective fire and semi-automatic rifles. I will examine the first production AR15 SP1 right up to the current configuration Colt is producing.

These marks had individual characteristics that were positively compared with each other, leading to the conclusion that the marks had the same source. This report will show that the source of the marks was not from an integral part of the weapon. The metal chip in the shape of a half-moon was present in the AK-47 assault-rifle chamber during firing, imprinting marks on test-fired cartridge cases in a different orientation every time the weapon was fired. The chip was finally ejected during one of the test firings and was compared to the marks found on the fired cartridge cases. The question then arose: Can a firearms examiner rely upon positive comparison of marks with individual charateristics which are not from an integral part of the weapon?

The parallel striations evident on each test-fired cartridge case were a product of filing of the breechface.

For each shot fired the sound reduction, velocity of the projectile and relative accuracy were measured. Identical experiments were carried out using subsonic and supersonic ammunition to illustrate the aspects of sound due to the bullet travelling a speeds greater than 1125ft/s (343m/s). The purpose was to determine not only what effect each silencer had on the attributes of discharge but also to determine if there is a marked difference as a result of using a professional suppresser as opposed to more crude model. The professional suppresser used was a Jonathon Arthur Ciener Inc. model SM10/9mm-47. A major part of the project included the construction of a silencer for use in the study. The home made silencer was constructed in the lab for the expressed purpose of the study herein. Common hardware items were used and lightly machined to fit specifications. Aluminum tubing, metal washers and rubber baffles were the primary components involved. No specific relationship between sound and velocity could be found. The home made silencer reduced sound more efficiently, however, the Ciener was more accurate and managed to cut noise while increasing velocity. The homemade suppresser slowed the supersonic shots to speeds below that of sound.","Ciener, suppressor, baffles, precursor wave, blow-by, supersonic crack, jet noise, muzzle blast",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2004,Firearms,Firearms

It was found that certain fuels will spontaneously diesel, yielding a boost in velocity of as much as twice the standard velocity. The occurrence of dieseling is dependent on a number of factors, but most importantly the properties of the fuel. Some fuels spontaneously combust, while others need a secondary source of ignition. Pellet weight, pellet fit, and over-lubrication of the piston causing dieseling have implications for forensic testing of airguns. As with firearms, when possible the examiner should test the same gun and ammunition combination as was used to commit a crime. This is the only way to assure accurate velocity and energy determination.

They assumed their greater experience regarding incapacitant sprays would lend support to this policy. This article examines the outside influences involved in the adoption of incapacitant sprays in the England and Wales. It discusses the research conducted on health and operational matters concerning incapacitant sprays as well as identifying the policy objectives of adopting incapacitant sprays.

These incidents frequently give rise to questions regarding the injury-producing capabilities of such guns. Such inquiries often start with the issue of skin perforation. These guns are available in calibers from .177 inch to .25 in. with projectiles consisting of .173 in. steel spheres to soft lead projectiles in a variety of shapes and weights in .177, .20, .22 and .25 caliber. The nature of their ammunition and the ability to regulate and select velocity to a greater extent than bulleted cartridges makes them useful in assessing threshold velocities for skin penetration and perforation.

In each subsequent step in the processing of lead at the smelter and at the ammunition manufacturer, the size of an individual homogeneous melt of lead decreases as more distinct compositions are formed as a result of remelting and mixing of sources, including lead scrap. The ammunition manufacturer in this study produced at least 10 compositionally distinguishable groups of bullet wire in a 19.7-h period. The largest group could potentially be used to produce a maximum of 1.3 million compositionally indistinguishable 40 grain bullets.",Bullet; Criminalistics; Elemental analysis; Forensic science; ICP-AES; Lead analysis; Trace evidence,alloy; antimony; arsenic; bismuth; cadmium; copper; lead; silver; tin; article; atomic emission spectrometry; ballistics; bullet; chemical analysis; forensic science; priority journal; sampling; smelter,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036381126,,IFSMS 2004,Firearms,Firearms

While relatively close range determinations derived from pattern testing are common and well known, the exterior and terminal ballistics of the individual pellets can be of interest insofar as questions regarding lethality and injury-producing capabilities at ranges on the order of 50 yards and more. Two techniques (Doppler radar and the Oehler M43 PBL system) were used to study the exterior ballistic performance of standard .33 caliber 00 buckshot. The effects of variations in the surface texture and topography of individual buckshot pellets were also studied and found to only have a small effect on exterior ballistic performance. The two techniques gave comparable results for the exterior ballistic performance of buckshot pellets of the same weight and surface texture and allowed a useful ballistic coefficient to be derived for 00 buckshot pellets. This value is useful in future casework for estimating down range velocities of fired buckshot pellets and in evaluating the potential for injury by these projectiles at relatively long ranges. Standard 10%w/w ordnance gelatin at 40C with and without a skin simulant was used to study the wound ballistic aspects of these soft lead spheres at selected impact velocities. The plot of penetration vs. impact velocity was prepared from this work is useful in estimating range of fire for soft tissue gunshot wounds produced by distant fire of 00 buckshot pellets.","buckshot, exterior ballistics, terminal ballistics, maximum range, ballistic coefficient, Doppler radar, Oehler M43 PBL system",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2004,Firearms,Firearms

Examples include .380 Automatic ammunition in 9mm Makarovs, 9mm Luger in 40 S&W pistols and .270 Winchester in 30-'06 rifles. The bullets ballot down the bore acquiring intermittent rifling marks and emerge with reduced muzzle velocities. Most of these bullets are not spin-stabilized and tumble in flight. As a consequence they have very poor exterior ballistic properties. In the case of 9mm bullets from a .40 S&W pistol, ballistic coefficients are on the order of 0.025 to 0.030 compared to values of .14 to .20 for spin-stabilized 9mm bullets weighing 115 grains to 147 grains. Bullet holes in clothing and entry wounds produced by these balloted bullets will frquently reflect their tumbling nature followed by relatively shallow bullet penetration depths in tissue due to yawed impacts and reduced impact velocity. The necks of the fired cartridge cases will expand to fit the chamber often without splitting. Nine-millimter Luger cartridges must be manually extracted and ejected from a .40 S&W pistol whereas .380 Automatic cartridges will cycle the action of a 9mm Makarov.","ballot, balloting bullets, rifling impressions, internal ballistics, exterior ballistics, wound ballistics, ballistic coefficient, Yuma Proving Grounds, Doppler radar",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2004,Firearms,Firearms

Such conclusions have been based on the elemental analysis of isolated groups of bullets with no consideration of the metallurgical processes involved in the production and refining of the bullet lead alloys. An understanding of the metallurgy of lead refining reveals that the elements quantified in the forensic analysis are carefully controlled in the refining process and that there are logical reasons why some elements are more discriminatory than others. Data for lead alloys supplied to two major ammunition manufacturers confirm that multiple indistinguishable shipments of lead alloys from secondary lead refiners to the ammunition manufacturers are made each year and over a period of many years. The data also demonstrate that distinguishable compositions can come from the same melt or ""source"" of lead alloy. These results clearly indicate that bullets with indistinguishable compositions could have come from different lead ""sources"" produced in the same or different years. Furthermore, the observation that two bullets have a distinguishable composition does not necessarily mean that they came from a different ""source"". Our results show that the forensic examiner using a method of bullet lead alloy elemental analysis, which quantifies up to six elements is restricted to concluding only that indistinguishable bullets might have come from the same ""source,"" not that they did come from the same ""source"". In addition, it is quite possible that multiple bullets with similar but distinguishable compositions could have come from the same ""source"". The authors therefore feel that there is no scientific validity to any conclusions more positive than attributing the possible association as to molten source among bullets from different samples. An understanding of the metallurgical principles operative in the melting/casting process as well as the data acquired for this study, indicate that any forensic conclusions which associate unknown bullets with the ""same source"", and/or ""same box"" should fail most or all Daubert criteria. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Springer, Division of Identification and Forensic Science (DIFS) Israel National Police","Over the past two years, there has been a tremendous rise in terrorism experienced throughout Israel. One of the main weapons used in these terror -related incidents has been the M-16 assault rifle. In general, the marks on cartridge cases used for IBIS system comparison purposes include those left by the firing pin, breech face and ejector. However, there are firearms whose toolmarks are of a quality and shape that do not allow for IBIS generated results' such as the M-16, and other assault rifles, whose firing pin and breech face markings are weak and who leave no regular ejector mark (although there is an ejector cut-out mark). It was therefore decided to investigate the feasability of using a better mark, such as the extractor mark, instead of the ejector cut-out mark. In the first stage of this work, data was collected from existing X-file cartridge cases to see how many had the ejector cut-out mark as opposed to the extractor mark. A statistical survey was performed as to see how often these marks appear when looking at a variety of ammunition types fired from many M-16's. Because the IBIS optics could not accommodate the full cut-out mark, the protocol used in our laboratory was to acquire either the top portion or the bottom portion (sub-areas). Here too, it was decided to collect data regarding these two areas. Two hundred and thirty cartridge cases fired from fifty-six weapons were examined. These cartridges were taken from the x-file of real cases. After a preliminary examination, three sub-areas from the ejector cut-out mark and two sub-areas from the extractor mark were chosen for closer examination. In the next stage, the present IBIS system's capability of dealing with the targeted marks was examined. M-16's from the lab's collection were fired and the cartridge cases were collected and acquired into the system. Five areas from each cartridge case were acquired; the three sub-areas of the ejector cut-out mark and the two sub-areas of the extractor mark. The goal of this work was to examine the possibility of improving the IBIS' ability to deal with cartridge case comparisons from firearms such as the M-16 or other assault rifles such as the Galil, Kalachnikov, M-14, etc. The extractor mark in the M-16 was found to be present in most (91%) of the cartridge cases examined and proved to be very useful for correlation purposes. The chamber lug marks also seem to be important for use in comparison work. With some changes and modifications, the IBIS could be adapted to use protocols for aquiring these marks. These marks are more useful for comparison purposes and could either replace or be used in addition to the firing pin and breech face mark.","IBIS, 5.56 NATO, M-16, ejector, extractor, firing pin, breechface",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2004,Firearms,Firearms

These databases store images of cartridge cases and the marks on them. Image matching is used to create hit lists that show which marks on a cartridge case are most similar to another cartridge case. The research in this paper is focused on the different methods of feature selection and pattern recognition that can be used for optimizing the results of image matching.The images are acquired by side light images for the breech face marks and by ring light for the firing pin impression. For these images a standard way of digitizing the images used. For the side light images and ring light images this means that the user has to position the cartridge case in the same position according to a protocol. The positioning is important for the sidelight, since the image that is obtained of a striation mark depends heavily on the angle of incidence of the light. In practice, it appears that the user positions the cartridge case with ±10° accuracy.We tested our algorithms using 49 cartridge cases of 19 different firearms, where the examiner determined that they were shot with the same firearm. For testing, these images were mixed with a database consisting of approximately 4900 images that were available from the Drugfire database of different calibers.In cases where the registration and the light conditions among those matching pairs was good, a simple computation of the standard deviation of the subtracted gray levels, delivered the best-matched images. For images that were rotated and shifted, we have implemented a 'brute force' way of registration. The images are translated and rotated until the minimum of the standard deviation of the difference is found. This method did not result in all relevant matches in the top position. This is caused by the effect that shadows and highlights are compared in intensity. Since the angle of incidence of the light will give a different intensity profile, this method is not optimal.For this reason a preprocessing of the images was required. It appeared that the third scale of the 'à trous' wavelet transform gives the best results in combination with brute force. Matching the contents of the images is less sensitive to the variation of the lighting.The problem with the brute force method is however that the time for calculation for 49 cartridge cases to compare between them, takes over 1 month of computing time on a Pentium II-computer with 333MHz. For this reason a faster approach is implemented: correlation in log polar coordinates. This gave similar results as the brute force calculation, however it was computed in 24h for a complete database with 4900 images.A fast pre-selection method based on signatures is carried out that is based on the Kanade Lucas Tomasi (KLT) equation. The positions of the points computed with this method are compared. In this way, 11 of the 49 images were in the top position in combination with the third scale of the à trous equation. It depends however on the light conditions and the prominence of the marks if correct matches are found in the top ranked position. All images were retrieved in the top 5% of the database. This method takes only a few minutes for the complete database if, and can be optimized for comparison in seconds if the location of points are stored in files.For further improvement, it is useful to have the refinement in which the user selects the areas that are relevant on the cartridge case for their marks. This is necessary if this cartridge case is damaged and other marks that are not from the firearm appear on it.

The main objective of such systems is to enable the analysis of large amounts of evidence, therefore, transforming the comparison of firearms evidence from an evidence verification tool into a crime-fighting tool. Two such systems have been widely used in United States forensic laboratories; namely, the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS) (1) and DRUGFIRE (2). Both IBIS and DRUGFIRE have in common the fact that their characterization of a specimen is based on a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the specimen's surface. Although these systems have provided satisfactory results in the identification of cartridge cases, their performance in the identification of bullets has not yet met firearms examiner's expectations. This project was motivated by the premise that a better characterizations of the bullet's surface should translate into better performance of automated identification systems. A three-dimensional (3D) characterization of the bullet's surface is proposed as an alternative to a 2D characterization. This paper discusses the development and preliminary results obtained with SCICLOPS™, an automated microscopic comparison system based on the use of a 3D characterization of a bullet's surface.",3D forensic imaging; Automated comparison of microscopic firearms evidence; Firearms identification; Forensic science,article; automation; ballistics; bullet; comparative study; device; firearm; priority journal; surface property; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036846874,,IFSMS 2004,Firearms,Firearms
Banno A.,,Possibility of Bullet Identification Using 3D Data,2003,Japanese Journal of Science and Technology for Identification,8,1,,81,97,,,doi.org/10.3408/jasti.8.89,,,,"This study focuses on identification of bullets with three-dimensional data of landmark impressions. Generally, forensic scientists identify bullets by optical tools. For example, a comparison microscope, a CCD camera and photographs etc. Although these approaches are very essential and effective, the appearance of a striation depends on an illumination system in these methods. Therefore, there might remain some problems in the database that consist of only photometric data. On the other hand, 3D data of impressions on fired bullets are expected to possess generality and objectivity for forensic identification because the database that consists of geometric data is perfectly independent of any illumination. In this study, I used a confocal microscope as a 3D measurement device. I examined two jacketed bullets fired from a 0.25 caliber gun and six jacketed bullets fired from three 0.32 caliber guns. Each bullet had six landmark impressions, and there were twenty-four pairs of landmark impressions to be compared. The texture of a landmark impression is uniform along the direction of the scratch. It is expected that 3D profile is also uniform along the direction, so averaging 3D data along the direction can reduce an influence of measurement error. The averaged profile, shown as a 2D curve, fills the role of a characteristic profile. The 2D comparison of these profiles serves as bullet identification. Minute variations that form vivid striation were not shown clearly because of the averaging procedure.

This is demonstrated in the case of a patterned blunt injury to the face of a victim, which injury was subsequently proven by FPHG to have been caused by a blow from the muzzle of a soft air gun. The objects to be evaluated had to be series photographed in order to be evaluated virtually on the computer. These photo series were then analyzed with the RolleiMetric system. This system measures and calculates the spatial location of distinctive points on the objects' surfaces, and creates 3D data models of the objects. In a 3D/CAD program, the ""virtual 3D model of the injury"" is then compared against the ""virtual 3D model of the possible injury-causing instrument"". The validation of FPHG, as shown by the 3D match between certain characteristics of the muzzle form and the facial injury, demonstrates how this 3D method can be used for patterned wound documentation and analysis. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

It is the examiner's responsibility to analyze evidence and determine if a positive identification exists. There are two similar methods for establishing an identification: traditional pattern recognition and pattern recognition with consecutive matching striations (CMS) utilizing the conservative numerical criteria. All examiners use the traditional pattern recognition method, which usually generates reliable and valid results when applied properly. Because the possibility of making a misidentificaton still exists, some examiners feel there is a need to utilize a more objective method. Whether an examiner employs the traditional pattern recognition method or CMS with the conservative criteria for identification, it is essential for them to be able to communicate the reliability of their examination methods and conclusions clearly and convincingly in a courtroom.","confidence level, conservative criteria, consecutive matching striations (CMS)",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2004,Firearms,Firearms

The big-game hunting bullet (17.4 g, approx. 810 m/s) has a solid copper-alloy hollow point design including a lead core limited to the rear portion. The range of firing was 20 m and the angle of impact was 90°. A large fragment (10.9 g) consisting of the main part of the copper portion was deformed in a peculiar manner similar to a tube or ring and wounded the left hand of the person shooting. The unique fragment trajectory strictly against the line of fire and the velocity sufficient to shatter bone after a distance of 20 m can be explained by an extraordinary deformation mechanism. Unlike in tissue, the high resistance of the steel plate caused the lead core in the rear of the bullet to move forward perforating the central copper barrier behind the hollow point cavity. Thus, the peculiar fragment was created. The subsequent backwards acceleration of the ring-like fragment was probably caused by the partly elastic impact of the copper-alloy portion against the hard steel plate. Due to the perpendicular impact resulting in a centric and symmetrical deformation, the fragment moved in a direction exactly backwards along the original line of fire.",Bullet fragment; Fragment injury; Gunshot wound; Ricochet,"alloy; copper; acceleration; article; bullet; case report; clinical feature; gunshot injury; human; pain assessment; priority journal; safety; velocity; Hand Injuries; Humans; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034783424,,IFSMS 2004,Firearms,Firearms

Different mechanisms have been discussed in literature as being responsible for the creation of the muzzle imprint. Experimenting upon the synthetic non biological skin-skull-brain model, our goal was to document and study the creation of the muzzle imprint with the aid of high-speed photography. In our experiments, we could document with our high-speed photography (at exposure rates in the range of nanoseconds) the bulging, the pressing against the muzzle, and the splitting of the artificial skin. Furthermore, it was possible to photographically record the back pattern of synthetic tissue particles. And, the soot and gunpowder cavity could be reproduced experimentally.

Despite widespread faith in “ballistics fingerprinting,” this article contends that because of systemic scientific problems, firearms and toolmark identifications should be inadmissible across-the-board. This article explains that similarities between toolmarks made by different tools and differences between toolmarks made by the same tool imply that a statistical question must be answered to determine whether a particular tool was the source of an evidence toolmark. What is the likelihood that the toolmarks made by a randomly selected tool of the same type would do as good a job as the toolmarks made by the suspect tool at matching the characteristics of the evidence toolmark? Firearms and toolmark examiners evade this question by claiming to be able to single out a particular firearm or other tool as the source of an evidence toolmark. The article further explains that the absence of statistical empirical foundations cannot be excused on the ground that, regardless of how they do it, firearms and toolmark examiners reach accurate identity conclusions. Although firearms and toolmark examiners have feared that Daubert would lead courts to exclude their testimony, both before and after Daubert, firearms and toolmark identification testimony has largely been admitted as a matter of course. No court, including the two recent courts that have excluded particular identification testimony, has recognized the systemic scientific problems with the field. Nonetheless, because of the risk that innocent people will be convicted or even sentenced to death on the basis of erroneous identifications, all firearms and toolmark identifications should be excluded until adequate statistical empirical foundations and profiency testing are developed for the field.",,,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2007,Firearms,Firearms
Nichols R.,,The scientific foundations of firearms and tool mark identification – A response to recent challenges,2006,The CACNews,,,,8,27,,,,,,,"Recently, an article was published in The Columbia Science and Technology Law Review entitled “A Systemic Challenge to the Reliability and Admissibility of Firearms and Toolmark Identification.” The author, Dr. Adina Schwartz, is an Associate Professor with the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Graduate Center, City University of New York. Dr. Schwartz uses the framework of an amicus brief written on behalf of the defense in the case United States v. Kain to expound on her arguments as to why “all firearms and toolmark identifications should be excluded until the development of firm statistical empirical foundations for identification and a rigorous regime of blind proficiency testing.” Outlining her treatise, Schwartz first discusses the scientific issues related to firearms and tool mark identification. These scientific issues include: • The types of tool marks o Class o Subclass o Individual • Three major sources of misidentification o Individual characteristics are comprised of non-unique marks o Subclass characteristics may be confused with individual characteristics o Individual marks of a particular tool change over time • A call for statistical treatment using DNA as an analogy • The lack of adequate proficiency testing • Fundamental problems not cured by development of “computerized firearms database” Subsequent to her discussion of the scientific issues, Schwartz discusses some of the case law related to firearms and tool mark identification. She does this to illustrate, in her opinion, that, “no state or federal court – either before or after Daubert – has understood the scientific problems with firearms and toolmark identification.” The purpose of this article is to review and assess the arguments made by Schwartz and to evaluate the basis of support cited to support those arguments. It will be demonstrated throughout this article that the challenge offered by Schwartz is not as substantiated as an uncritical review of her article would suggest. There are numerous instances in which studies and articles are inappropriately quoted or inaccurately paraphrased. During the discussion of some of the scientific issues, there is an apparent lack of understanding of the relative significance as applied to the science of firearm and tool mark identification. While the author was apparently aware of the large number of articles available that can be used to address many of these issues, there was no mention of them made in her argument. Furthermore, there were instances in which research into some of these primary resources, rather than reliance on some secondary resources, would have been much more enlightening.",,,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2007,Firearms,Firearms

This article reviews those challenges and offers substantial support for the scientific foundations of the firearms and tool mark identification discipline. A careful review of the available literature has revealed that firearms and tool mark identification is rooted in firm scientific foundations, critically studied according to the precepts of the scientific method culminating in the Association of Firearms and Toolmark Examiners' Theory of Identification. Firearms and tool mark identification has been validated in a manner appropriate for evidence of the kind to be expected in firearms and tool mark examinations. Proficiency tests and error rates have been studied and can provide consumers of the disciple with a useful guide as to the frequency with which misidentifications are reported in the community using appropriate methodologies and controls. As a result, the primary issues in recent challenges do not invalidate the firearms and tool mark discipline as a science nor should it detract it from its admissibility in a court of law.

The sealant most often used is a nitrocellulose-based lacquer. Lacquers exhibit plastic properties, allowing them to act as a protective layer between the breech and the base of the cartridge. In this study it was determined that the presence of such sealants reduced the transfer of characteristic breechface marks to cartridge cases. Comparisons with cases that had the lacquer removed prior to discharge characteristically differed in appearance from those fired with the lacquer present. While the grossest class and individual characteristics transferred in both cases, the finest of these marks were consistently lost and the remaining marks were reduced in intensity. Both cartridge cases fired with and those fired without sealant could still be identified as being from the same gun by microscopic examination; however, the differences in the appearance of the striations affected the match quality obtained through the IBIS computerized image matching database.","breechface marks, lacquer, nitrocellulose, primer sealant",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2007,Firearms,Firearms

A microscopic comparison of the pre-latent print examination (pre-LPE) and post-latent print examination (post-LPE) of the microscopic marks on the bullets was conducted. It was concluded that superglue does mask microscopic marks to a minimal extent. However, it does not interfere with traditional methods of firearms identification. All bullets fired post-LPE were positively identified with bullets fired pre-LPE, with the exception of one. The exception was the 9mm Luger (9x19mm) Glock Model-19, the bullets were not identifiable because of the method in which Glock barrels are manufactured and not because of the superglue technique.

By doing this, the examination of an expended ammunition component could lead one back to the original purchaser of the firearm, without the need to recover the actual firearm. This would offer law enforcement a tool that current instrumental tools, designed to examine accidental markings, seem unable to deliver.

Twenty-five rounds of Federal, Remington, and Winchester jacketed ammunition were fired through three firearms: a.38 calibre revolver, a.32 calibre semi-automatic pistol and a.45 calibre semi-automatic pistol. Though analysis of variance showed a significant difference in breech face, firing pin, and bullet scores based on the ammunition brand used, no single brand performed best in all calibres or all types of markings studied. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated that there is no consistent or significant deterioration in IBIS scores over 25 firings. Only the.38 calibre bullets consistently showed the expected inverse relationship between IBIS scores and the number of rounds fired between correlated samples, but only in half the cases was this trend statistically significant. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,analysis of variance; article; automation; ballistics; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; firearm; forensic identification; Integrated Ballistics Identification System; parameter; scoring system; statistical analysis; system analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27144542967,,IFSMS 2007,Firearms,Firearms

The success of these databases has led many to propose that all firearms in circulation be entered into a reference ballistic image database (RBID). To assess the performance of an RBID, we fired 4200 cartridge cases from 600 9mm Para Sig Sauer model P226 series pistols. Each pistol fired two Remington cartridges, one of which was imaged in the RBID, and five additional cartridges, consisting of Federal, Speer, Winchester, Wolf, and CCI brands. Randomly selected samples from the second series of Remington cartridge cases and from the five additional brands were then correlated against the RBID. Of the 32 cartridges of the same make correlated against the RBID, 72% ranked in the top 10 positions. Likewise, of the 160 cartridges of the five different brands correlated against the database, 21% ranked in the top 10 positions. Generally, the ranking position increased as the size of the RBID increased. We obtained similar results when we expanded the RBID to include firearms with the same class characteristics for breech face marks, firing pin impressions, and extractor marks. The results of our six queries against the RBID indicate that a reference ballistics image database of new guns is currently fraught with too many difficulties to be an effective and efficient law enforcement tool. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The Integrated Ballistics Identification System, which is based on a two-dimensional representation of the specimen surface, has been widely adopted in forensic laboratories worldwide. More recently, some attempts to develop systems based on three-dimensional (3D) representations of the specimen surface have been made, both in the literature and as industrial products, such as BulletTRAX-3D, but fundamental limitations in achieving fully automated identification remain. This work analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of a 3D-based approach by proposing an approach and a prototype system for firearms evidence comparison that is based on the acquisition and analysis of the 3D surface topography of specimens, with particular reference to cartridge cases. The concept of 3D virtual comparison microscope is introduced, whose purpose is not to provide fully automated identification, but to show how the availability of 3D shape information can provide a whole new set of verification means, some of them being described and discussed in this work, specifically, visual enhancement tools and quantitative measurement of shape properties, for supporting, not replacing, the firearm examiner in reaching the final decision.

While these optical methods are easily manageable and effective, they are under great influence of illumination condition. In other words, appearances of striations through these optical devices have possibility to be changed by lighting condition. Besides these appearance-based approaches, we can utilize three dimensional (3D) geometric data of tool marks that are free from lighting condition. In this study, we focused on 3D geometric data of landmark impressions on fired bullets for identification. We obtained the 3D surface data of tool marks by a confocal microscope and reconstructed virtual impressions on a PC monitor from the geometric data. Furthermore, the 3D data are exploited to numerical matching of two surface shapes. We also visualized the difference of two shapes. In order to do this, two surface models are aligned automatically. In this process, pairings of correspondent points on both surfaces are determined. Distance analysis between these pairs leads to a shape comparison. Since comparison results are visualized, they are intuitive and easily perceptive. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Alignment; Fired bullets; Shape difference; Three dimensional,article; bullet; comparative study; confocal microscopy; geometry; image analysis; microcomputer; model; priority journal; three dimensional imaging,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242338826,,IFSMS 2007,Firearms,Firearms

Haag L.C.,,Sequence of shots through tempered glass,2004,AFTE Journal,36,1,,54,64,,,,,,"By: Lucien C. Haag, Forensic Science Services, Inc. P.O. Box 5347 Carefree, AZ 85377","The first projectile to strike and perforate windows made of tempered glass will produce dense radial fractures around the margin of the bullet hole. These will be relatively short in length and quickly transition to the well-known diced pattern of small square and rectangular cracks. If the shattered panel of tempered glass does not fall out of its framework and is struck by additional projectiles, the subsequent bullet holes will lack radial fractures and the bullet will simply knock out an area of previously failed glass. These differences allow the first impact to be differentiated from all subsequent strikes. Careful examination of the recovered bullets can also allow shot sequence to be established. This determination is based on the appearance of the impact damage to the nose and ogive of the bullet. The bullet responsible for the first strike will sustain a shiny to dull flattened area where it yielded to the smooth, intact glass prior to the failure of the glass. Bullets or projectiles striking previously failed and diced tempered glass will often acquire impact damage in the form of facets as a result of striking the small, diced pieces of the failed tempered glass. If these facets survive subsequent terminal ballistic events, they establish the bullet as a subsequent shot and differentiate it from the bullet or projectile responsible for the first strike. These phenomena can be very useful in the reconstruction of shooting cases involving bullet perforation of tempered glass.Buy Journal (non-members) Buy this Article ($5) (non-members)Members login to view.","glass, tempered glass, strengthened glass, double strength glass, radial fractures, cone fractures, dicing, facets, terminal ballistics",,Article,,,,ISBN-13:978-0-12-088473-5; ISBN-10:0-12-088473-9,,IFSMS 2007,Firearms,Firearms

These methods were compared using the results of thirteen 9 mm × 19 mm pistol and five 7.62 mm × 39 mm rifle bullets shot into 10% ballistic gelatine. The Wound Profile Method gave the highest correlation, 0.89, with the measured amounts of dissipated kinetic energy. The Fissure surface area and total crack length method gained 0.51 and 0.52, respectively. The experimental results were also compared with those from pig tests with the same bullet types. Using the z-test at 95% level of confidence no difference between impact velocity normalized bullet decelerations could be determined for the 9 mm bullet used. The same test showed significant difference for 7.62 mm bullets. That, however, can be considered to be the result of the bullet's tendency to tumble in non-homogenous living tissue causing significant dispersion of observed deceleration values. The results add further evidence supporting the validity of 10% gelatine at +4°C as wound ballistic tissue simulant. The study also introduces the use of an elastic ""shroud"" to hold the gelatine in place, to some extent reduce the effects of asymmetric expansion of the gelatine and to simulate the expansion suppression effect of surrounding tissues. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

They, however, do not have a surface layer which simulates the effect of human skin. The purpose of this research was to find a suitable skin simulant for enhancing the testing fidelity and the credibility of the results with gelatine-based materials when assessing the injury potential of not only high energy bullets, but also especially that of non-penetrating ""less lethal"" kinetic impact ammunition and relatively low energy ricochet fragments. A skin simulant also permits the simulation and assessment of exit wounds. The mechanical and ballistic properties of human skin and target simulant were established on the basis of results found in the literature. Some errors in these were found. The corrected values are included in this paper for comparison. The target values of the mechanical properties of the skin simulant were the following: threshold velocity v(th)=94+/-4 m/s, tensile strength 18+/-2 N/mm2 and elongation at break 65+/-5%. A selection of synthetic and natural materials was evaluated as skin simulants by analysing their mechanical and ballistic properties. The results were compared to literature values obtained with human cadavers. The tests showed that the best skin simulant of the ones evaluated was semi-finished chrome tanned upholstery ""crust"" cowhide of 0.9-1.1 mm nominal thickness. Its threshold velocity was 90.7 m/s, tensile strength 20.89+/-4.11 MPa and elongation at break 61+/-9%. These values are the same as the average values of human skin.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators. © 2009 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Identification of the landmarks between bullets from different brands of cartridges was difficult because their general appearance differed greatly. Difference in bullet diameters was found to be a major cause of changes in landmarks among different manufacturer's bullets. Although the depth and number of striations decreased gradually, reproducibility of breechface marks on the primers of cartridges was rather good. The diameter of firing pin indentations also differed among different brands of cartridges. Although the reproducibility of the diameter of circular lines on firing pin indentations was good, the detail in these circular lines fluctuated a great deal.

Although the significance of the correspondences of these impression marks has been empirically justified, there is a conspicuous absence of any theoretical foundation for the likelihood. What is presented here is the derivation of the formulae for calculating the probability for the correspondence of the impression marks on a subject bullet to a random distribution of a similar number of impression marks on a suspect bullet of the same type. The approach to the calculation entails subdividing the impression marks into a series of individual lines having widths equal to the separation distance at which a misalignment of striations between the two bullets cannot be distinguished. This distance depends upon the resolution limit imposed by the microscope as well as by the visual acuity of the examiner. A calculation of the probabilities for finding pairs and triplets of consecutively matching lines on nonmatching bullets, by an examiner with normal perception using a microscope at 40x magnification, produces values that agree well with the empirical probabilities determined by Biasotti in the 1950s and when determined for larger consecutive sequences suggest that they are extremely unlikely to occur. The formulae can be used to determine the probabilities for the random occurrence of any sequence of striae and provide a straightforward way to quantitatively justify the significance of a specific match between any two bullets. © 2008 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Firearms examination; Forensic science; Impression evidence; Statistical justification,article; ballistics; bullet; calculation; microscope; perception; priority journal; quantitative analysis; visual acuity,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47349123407,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

Seven different types of 9mm Luger cartridges and four different firearms were used with four different breech face manufacturer marks: parallel, circular, arc, and granular. Hardness and primer thickness were determined before firing. Hardness was also determined after firing. Nickel plating added to the hardness of primer cups, and hardness significantly increased after the firing process, especially at the location of the firing pin impression. Fired cartridge cases were then compared to a breech face cast of the firearm they were discharged from. The results of these studies demonstrated notable and consistent differences in marks on the primer cup.

Ten consecutively rifled handgun barrels were test fired to obtain reference sample and known match sample pairs for upload onto both bullet acquisition systems. Both copper-jacketed and lead bullets were uploaded, to account for variations in the manner in which markings are reproduced on the different metal compositions. Ranked correlation lists were examined and evaluated. For copper-jacketed bullet correlations, both IBIS and BulletTRAX-3D identified all reference samples to their known matches within the top 10 positions. For lead bullets, BulletTRAX-3D identified all reference samples to their known match in the top 10 positions while IBIS identified only 30%. For inter composition comparisons, BulletTRAX-3D was more successful than IBIS, identifying 100% of reference samples to their known match in the top 20 for copper-jacketed to lead comparisons and 90% for lead to copper-jacketed comparisons. These results suggest that BulletTRAX-3D is more effective than IBIS in the analysis of a wider range of bullet types and it was also found to produce images of superior quality. © 2008 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",BulletTRAX-3D; Fired bullets; Forensic science; Integrated ballistics identification system,copper; lead; metal; article; ballistics; bullet; intermethod comparison; priority journal; reproducibility; technology; weapon,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43449085221,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

On the way to the solution, one of the most important phases is data acquisition. To be able to identify firearms in a reliable way, all the striated and impressed marks on metallic surfaces of cartridge cases should be visible. But two-dimensional images of cartridge cases are very sensitive to the type and direction of the light source(s). Depending on illumination conditions, the images of marks change drastically and sometimes they simply disappear. But, if the three-dimensional (3D) topography of the surface is obtained, the geometry of the marks, which is independent of the illumination, is available. Thus, by providing illumination independent features that can be used for automated matching, 3D data have the potential to make automated matching much reliable. In the literature on data acquisition for automated firearms identification, a few different ways of three-dimensional surface extraction are described, like laser interferometry or laser profilometry. This study presents a real life application of another method, photometric stereo, for the acquisition of 3D topographic data for cartridge cases, which is the one used in BALISTIKA Ballistics Image Analysis and Recognition System. In order to construct 3D topographic data, first of all, two-dimensional images were acquired using a specially designed set-up. After the images were calibrated radiometrically, photometric stereo method was applied. In order to minimize the low-frequency errors in the final surface, a surface-fitting algorithm was used. The method uses low-cost equipment and image acquisition is not time-consuming. Results were compared to interferometric measurement values for error assessment. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a new radiological imaging modality that allows radio-opaque objects to be localised and assessed in three dimensions. The full potential of the use of CBCT in forensic medicine has not yet been explored. In this study, three different modern projectiles were fired into the heads of pig cadavers (n = 6) under standardised conditions. Tissue destruction and the location of the projectiles were analysed separately using CBCT and multi-slice computed tomography (MDCT). The projectiles had the same kinetic energy but showed considerable differences in deformation behaviour. Within the study groups, tissue destruction was reproducible. CBCT is less severely affected by metallic artefacts than MDCT. Therefore CBCT is superior in visualising bone destruction in the immediate vicinity of the projectile and projectile deformation, whereas MDCT allows soft tissue to be evaluated in more detail. CBCT is an improved diagnostic tool for the evaluation of gunshot injuries. In particular, it is superior to MDCT in detecting structural hard-tissue damage in the immediate vicinity of high-density metal projectiles and in identifying the precise location of a projectile in the body. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A number of soft tissue ballistic simulants have been used to assess the damage to tissue caused by projectiles. Standard assessment of these materials, such as ballistic soap or ordnance gelatine, requires the block to be opened or that a mould to be made to visualize the wound track. This is time consuming and may affect the accuracy of the findings especially if the block dries and alters shape during the process. Therefore, accurate numerical analysis of the permanent or temporary cavity is limited. Computed tomography (CT) potentially offers a quicker non-invasive analysis tool for this task. Four commercially purchased ballistic glycerine soap blocks were used. Each had a single firearm discharged into it from a distance of approximately 15 cm using both gunshot and shotgun projectiles. After discharge, each block was imaged by a modern 16 slice multi-detector CT scanner and analysed using 3-D reconstruction software. Using the anterior-posterior and lateral scout views and the multi-plane reconstructed images, it was possible to visualize the temporary cavity, as well as the fragmentation and dispersal pattern of the projectiles, the distance travelled and angle of dispersal within the block of each projectile or fragment. A virtual cast of the temporary cavity can be also be made. Multi-detector CT with 3-D analysis software is shown to create a reliable permanent record of the projectile path allowing rapid analysis of different firearms and projectiles. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Ballistic soap; Cavity; Computed tomography; CT; Firearms; Forensic; Mobile; Radiology,"gelatin; glycerol; soap; accuracy; article; ballistics; computed tomography scanner; computer program; gunshot injury; multidetector computed tomography; priority journal; soft tissue; wound; Forensic Ballistics; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Models, Biological; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249061727,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

More specifically, it is still unclear which ammunition production or firing condition parameters may play an important role in the striae and marks formation process. From a practical point of view this situation is unfortunate because a proper knowledge of these parameters and conditions could help underpin and explain certain differences found in actual casework investigations. Additionally, a proper understanding of these issues could allow examiners to select or develop a near-optimal test firing procedure by using more detailed and controlled variations of certain intra- and/or inter-ammunition parameters than the ones that are in use today. In this paper, we discuss the results of an experiment aimed at evaluating the impact of primer seating depth variations on observed primer striae and other marks. First, three sets of cartridge cases with different seating depth intervals were selected. Second, each of these sets were fired consecutively using a selected pistol. Finally, the cartridge cases were examined using both traditional optical microscopes and three-dimensional (3D) profilometer techniques. The results reported in this paper show that in our experiments no important impact of the initial primer seating depth on the observed primer striae patterns could be found, but that the firing pin impression does seem to change if the initial seating depth is larger than a certain threshold. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The NIST topography measurement system is used for measurements and correlations of surface topography. The topography decays are quantified by the cross-correlation function maximum CCFmax. Based on the test, it is expected that 256 SRM casings can be replicated from the same master with CCFmax values higher than 95%. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Decay factor; Electro-forming; Standard casing; Surface metrology; Topography measurement,Decay (organic); Topography; Cross-correlation function; Decay factor; Measurement traceability; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Standard casing; Standard reference material; Surface metrology; Topography measurement; Surface topography,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48849095027,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

Automated search and retrieval systems are widely used for comparison of firearms evidence. In this study, 48 bullets fired from six different barrel manufacturers are classified into different groups based on the width class characteristic for each land engraved area of the bullets. Then the cross-correlation function is applied both for automatic selection of the effective correlation area, and for the extraction of a 2D bullet profile signature. Based on the cross-correlation maximum values, a list of top ranking candidates against a ballistics signature database of bullets fired from the same model firearm is developed. The correlation results show a 9.3% higher accuracy rate compared with a currently used commercial system based on optical reflection.

When a firearm is fired, it transfers these characteristics - in the form of microscopic scratches and dents - to the fired bullets and cartridge casings. The rifling of the barrel of the firearm marks the bullets travelling through it, and the firearm's breech mechanism marks the ammunition's cartridge casing. Characterising these marks is the critical element in identifying firearms. Traditionally the comparison of ballistic evidence has been a tedious and time-consuming process requiring highly skilled examiners. In the past decade, engineers have created automated ballistics identification systems that meld traditional comparison microscopes with digital cameras, computers, huge databases, and image analysis techniques. This kind of system can help investigators to link crimes by automatically finding similarities among images of bullet but suffering significant drawbacks and minimal matching. More recently, approaches based on 3D digital representations of evidence surface topography have started to appear, both in research and industrial products. Potentially the introduction of 3D surface topography measurement can overcome the limitations of digital imaging systems by making the bullet surface measurement reproducible and reliable. A 3D quantitative approach for bullet identification is proposed in this paper. In this system the surface topography of the whole bullet can be acquired for analysis and identification. Primary researches have been done by applying advanced surface topography techniques for bullet marks' characteristics extraction. A variety of 2D and 3D visualization graphics have also been provided to help firearm examiners to make final decisions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Every firearm, regardless of its size, make and model, has its own unique 'fingerprint'. These fingerprints transfer when a firearm is fired to the fired bullet and cartridge case. The components that are involved in producing these unique characteristics are the firing chamber, breech face, firing pin, ejector, extractor and the rifling of the barrel. These unique characteristics are the critical features in identifying firearms. It allows investigators to decide on which particular firearm that has fired the bullet. Traditionally the comparison of ballistic evidence has been a tedious and time-consuming process requiring highly skilled examiners. Therefore, the main objective of this study is the extraction and identification of suitable features from firing pin impression of cartridge case images for firearm recognition. Some previous studies have shown that firing pin impression of cartridge case is one of the most important characteristics used for identifying an individual firearm. In this study, data are gathered using 747 cartridge case images captured from five different pistols of type 9. mm Parabellum Vektor SP1, made in South Africa. All the images of the cartridge cases are then segmented into three regions, forming three different set of images, i.e. firing pin impression image, centre of firing pin impression image and ring of firing pin impression image. Then geometric moments up to the sixth order were generated from each part of the images to form a set of numerical features. These 48 features were found to be significantly different using the MANOVA test. This high dimension of features is then reduced into only 11 significant features using correlation analysis. Classification results using cross-validation under discriminant analysis show that 96.7% of the images were classified correctly. These results demonstrate the value of geometric moments technique for producing a set of numerical features, based on which the identification of firearms are made. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Correlation analysis; Discriminant analysis; Feature extraction; Firearm identification; Geometric moments,article; ballistics; bullet; controlled study; crime; discriminant analysis; firearm; forensic identification; image analysis; information processing; mathematical analysis; priority journal,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952291754,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

Correlations that include such bullets increase the workload and may affect the correlation accuracy. In this article, a parameter called striation density is proposed for determining and predicting bullet identifiability. After image preprocessing, edge detection and filtering techniques are used to extract the edges of striation marks, the resulting binary image distinctly shows the amount and distribution of striation marks. Then striation density is calculated for determining the quality of images. In the experiment, striation densities for six lands of 48 bullets fired from 12 gun barrels of six manufactures are calculated. Statistical results show strong relation between striation density and identification rate. It can provide firearms identification systems with a quantitative criterion to assess whether there are sufficient striae for reliable bullet identification. © 2010 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.

By way of compensation a scheme was introduced to allow the unrestricted possession and transfer of the newly prohibited arms, other firearms and ""prohibited weapons"", if de-activated to a standard acceptable to the Secretary of State. Approved standards for firearm de-activation were drawn up in 1989. The inspection of the de-activated arms was devolved to the two Gun Barrel Proof Houses at London and Birmingham, as otherwise the task of inspecting the thousands of guns involved would have overloaded the firearms section at the Huntingdon Forensic Science Service Laboratory, who were already dealing with criminal firearms cases submitted by 41 of the 43 police forces throughout England and Wales, as well as providing technical assistance to the Home Office and Government Ministers. Members of the Gun Trade made representations to the Minister involved during the initial stages of setting up the official de-activation standards. This resulted in some measure of compromise in the range and nature of the de-activation requirements. Although it was clear that some individuals possessing the necessary skill and equipment might attempt to restore the odd weapon to a working condition, the scheme appeared to work reasonably well for the next few years. However, over the passage of time, criminal casework submissions to the Huntingdon Laboratory from industrial city areas along the M62 corridor of northern England revealed a steadily growing trend in the use of re-activated arms, which in a significant number of cases involved the use of fully automatic weapons. At first, the nature of the re-activation processes used to restore these arms was quite crude. However, with the passage of time a steady improvement in the machining and welding skills used by the some of the culprits involved became more and more apparent, as was a move by them to bulk restoration. The use of restored arms in serious and often drug related crime, spread to the other mainland British cities, and eventually to Northern Ireland. More rigorous de-activation standards were introduced in 1995 to help counter this perceived threat, particularly in respect of handguns and full-automatic weapons. Blank cartridge pistols and air cartridge pistols were also being modified to allow their use with bulleted ammunition in the commission of criminal offences. As a result all air cartridge guns were placed into the prohibited weapons category in 2003, and the possession of imitation firearms in a public place without good reason, also became an offence. The Government is now considering further legislation, which will affect the sale of replica firearms and cartridge reloading equipment and materials. © 2007.",British firearms legislation; De-activated firearms; FBI General Rifling Characteristics Files (GRC) anomalies; Identification of re-activated firearms; Improvised firearms,article; crime; criminal law; criminology; firearm; government regulation; Ireland; law; standard; United Kingdom; weapon; Crime; Firearms; Great Britain; Humans; Northern Ireland; Ownership,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-35348875578,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

The Enhanced Bullet Identification System (EBIS) was GLOCK's most recent attempt in response to resolving this conflict. This method creates a signature in the barrel which imparts gross lines down the length of the barrel on the lands of the rifling. These gross lines vary in width, depth, and spatial relationship, much in appearance as a barcode would look. Small imperfections in the depths of these gross lines are also noted and appear to have been intended to have an impact on the appearance of the finer lines on the land engravings of the fired bullets. Durability testing was conducted to see the reproducibility of the signature markings after enduring 250-10,000 rounds of ammunition being fired through the barrels. Results showed that the gross lines endured, but there was a disparity with the finer lines. This disparity reduces the chances of identifying GLOCK bullets by a sufficient correspondence of individual characteristics; however, the manufacturing method lends itself to imparting class characteristics which may aid in differentiating one GLOCK bullet from another in a limited universe situation.","Enhanced Bullet Identification System (EBIS), Glock, The Miami Barrel",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

Oftentimes, forensic professionals rely on basic metal detectors to assist their efforts during metallic weapons searches. This has created a need for controlled research in the area of weapons searches, specifically to formulate guidelines for geophysical methods that may be appropriate for locating weapons that have been discarded or buried by criminals attempting to conceal their involvement in a crime. Controlled research allows not only for testing of geophysical equipment, but also for updating search methodologies. This research project was designed to demonstrate the utility of an all-metal detector for locating a buried metallic weapon through detecting and identifying specific types of buried metal targets. Controlled testing of 32 buried targets which represented a variety of sizes and metallic compositions included 16 decommissioned street-level firearms, 6 pieces of assorted scrap metals, and 10 blunt or bladed weapons. While all forensic targets included in the project were detected with the basic all-metal detector, the size of the weapon and surface area were the two variables that affected maximum depth of detection, particularly with the firearm sample. For example, when using a High setting the largest firearms were detected at a maximum depth of 55 cm, but the majority of the remaining targets were only detected at a maximum depth of 40 cm or less. Overall, the all-metal detector proved to be a very good general purpose metal detector best suited for detecting metallic items at shallow depths. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In cases of bullet penetration wounds it is often not possible to find such evidence. However, immunocytochemical investigations can accurately match a victim's injury to a particular bullet path through the body. In cases where expanding bullets have been used and the heart or liver has been struck by a projectile, it can be shown that the cells remaining on the bullet stem from those particular organs. In this case the specific cytological evidence was established by means of marking heart- and liver-specific tissue proteins with appropriate antibodies (cardiac troponin I and HepPar 1) followed by disclosure with an appropriate chromogen. Thus, in principle, cells can be used as evidence after being extracted from the projectiles by either damp cotton-wool swabs or adhesive trace evidence tape. Because of the specificity of the used immunocytochemical antibodies, finding evidence of an antigen on a particular projectile proves that it was the object that injured the organs. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Localized elemental analysis (using EDAX, coupled with SEM imaging) shows the presence of the constituents of salt in the initial deposits. Together with water and atmospheric oxygen - and with thermal enhancement - these are capable of driving a surface corrosion process.

Ionic salts present in the fingerprint residue corrode the metal surface to produce an image of the fingerprint that is both durable and resistant to cleaning of the metal. The degree of fingerprint enhancement appears independent of the elapsed time between deposition and heating but is very dependent on both the composition of the metal and the level of salt secretion by the fingerprint donor. Results are presented that show practical applications for the enhancement to fingerprints deposited in arson crime scenes, contaminated by spray painting, or deposited on brass cartridge cases prior to discharge. The corrosion of the metal surface is further exploited by the demonstration of a novel technique for fingerprint enhancement based on the electrostatic charging of the metal and then the preferential adherence of a metallic powder to the corroded part of the metal surface. © 2008 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Forensic science; Latent fingerprint; Metal surface; Print visualization,"metal; arson; article; chemical reaction; corrosion; crime; donor; electricity; finger dermatoglyphics; heating; human; priority journal; time; Corrosion; Dermatoglyphics; Electrostatics; Heat; Humans; Metals; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Paint; Surface Properties",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-47349118808,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

Bari, the capital city of the Italian region known as Apulia, is a leader with regard to the number of firearm deaths in Italy. This is mainly attributable to local organized crime groups which control a variety of illicit activities. This retrospective study analyzes autopsy data related to fatal firearm wounds, handled by the Institute of Legal Medicine [University of Bari], between 1988 and 2003. A total of 717 cases were selected and classified as follows: firearm homicides (634); suicides (82); and accidental death (1). A significant number of variables have been reviewed such as: month in which the violent event took place; the victims' nationalities; gender and age of victims; site and number of entrance wounds; weapon type used; and manner of death (i.e. homicide; suicide; accidental). Analysis has revealed a homicide versus suicide ratio of almost 8:1. Victims were mostly male with a lower mean age than in other similar studies. Homicides with multiple gunshot wounds were more common than ones with single entrance wounds. For example, in one case, 30 entrance wounds were identified in the murder of a gang boss. Four suicides with two entrance gunshot wounds were identified. Handguns were the most frequently used weapon in all groups (i.e. homicide, suicide, and accidental), with 7.65 mm and 9 mm being the most common calibres. This study revealed a very low incidence of suicide among females. Mental and other types of illness, as well as financial stress were the apparent motives which prompted most of the suicide victims.

There were 41 males and one female; and 26 Black, nine Hispanic, and seven White decedents. Ethanol and/or drugs of abuse were detected in 78% (31/40) of the decedents. The vast majority of shootings occurred with the police responding to a crime and 90% of the decedents were armed (26 handguns, six knives, one axe, one metal pipe, and one toy gun). Vehicles were used as weapons in two incidents. A total of 177 bullets struck the 42 decedents. Fourteen decedents sustained single gunshot wounds (GSWs), and the remainder had multiple GSWs ranging from 2 to 21. In the majority of the cases in this study, the number of GSWs of the body was three or fewer. Thirteen decedents had at least one GSW of the back or buttocks, accounting for 25 of the total 177 wounds, and four of the 13 had GSWs of only the back. With the exception of the upper extremities, GSWs of all locations were more likely to penetrate than perforate. Although these deaths may be high profile, the certification is typically straightforward and the cause (i.e., GSW) and manner of death (homicide) are readily apparent.

The incidence of homicide was significantly higher in San Diego County compared to Adelaide (p < 0.001), with a higher proportion of murder-suicides occurring in Adelaide. There were markedly more accidents and suicides involving males in Adelaide and a far higher number of male homicide victims in San Diego County compared to females. Rifles of 0.22-caliber were preferred weapons in South Australia, compared to handguns in San Diego County. © 2009 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Childhood; Firearm; Forensic science; Gunshot fatalities; Homicide; Pediatric; Suicide,"accidental death; adolescent; article; Australia; cause of death; child; childhood mortality; comparative study; controlled study; fatality; female; firearm; gunshot injury; homicide; human; incidence; infant; major clinical study; male; priority journal; sex difference; suicide; United States; Accidents; Adolescent; Age Distribution; Australia; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Firearms; Forensic Medicine; Homicide; Humans; Infant; Male; Retrospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Suicide; United States; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69649088404,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

The criminal investigation reports of suicides (n = 318) during the period 1991-2000, in the central judicial district of Eskisehir were investigated. 20.4% of all suicide cases (n = 65) used firearms. Firearm suicides were more common in males and their frequency decreased as age increased. The usage of long-barrelled weapons was 47.7%. Among the long-barrelled gunshots, twelve were shotguns and the remaining were military riffles. Forty-five weapons were legal. Thirty-four out of 45 gunshot suicide victims had licensed weapons because of their occupations. In the majority of cases, (72.3%) the shooting distance was contact or near contact. Most of the entrance wounds (75.0%) were located in the head and neck region and the direction of the bullet path was upward and front-to-back. Of all the gunshot suicides, 6.1% (n = 4) had multiple entrance and exit wounds. All of the victims were soldiers. In suicide cases using long-barrelled weapons (3/4), military rifles were set on automatic mode. In our study, at least eight of the victims survived for a period. To be able to increase the survival rate of the victims or improve the outcomes, intensive pre- and post-operative care is critical. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and FFLM.",Firearms; Gunshot injury; Multiple entrance wounds; Suicide,"adult; age distribution; article; controlled study; female; frequency analysis; gender bias; gunshot injury; head and neck injury; human; licence; major clinical study; male; medicolegal aspect; occupation; postoperative care; preoperative care; prognosis; soldier; suicide; survival rate; survival time; Turkey (republic); Adult; Age Distribution; Female; Firearms; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Military Personnel; Occupations; Sex Distribution; Suicide; Turkey; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34047272687,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

One group of suicide (n = 72) and one group of homicide (n = 60) were statistically compared regarding age and sex of the victim, number of shots, range of fire, direction of the projectile(s), anatomical distribution of entrance sites, weapon and ammunition types and the nature of eventual associated traumatic lesions. The frequency of suicide was higher when the victim's age increased. Females constituted about 43% of the homicide victims and about 8% of the suicide victims. 51.5% of the homicide victims and about 10% of the suicide victims had sustained more than one gunshot wound. Close range was respectively found in 53.5% of the homicide cases and in all suicide cases. Most of the suicide cases (85% of the cases) showed typical entrance sites. Entrance sites in the limbs and lateral or posterior wall of the chest were only encountered in homicide cases. Associated traumatic lesions were found in about 23% of the homicide cases and in 18% of the suicide cases. In case of suicidal gunshots to the left chest, both upwards and downwards directions, and also both right-to-left and left-to-right directions can occur. From 22 suicide cases showing entrance wound in the mouth, a downwards direction was found in only one. This study underlines the importance but also the limits of the autopsy findings (including direction of the projectile(s) related to the entrance site) for giving an indication of the manner of death (homicide vs. suicide). © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In 2004 the High Court ruled that this policy was without legislative backing and since then the police began to issue certificates for firearms where the applicant is not disentitled under law from possessing a gun. Set against this backdrop, this paper explores the consequences of liberal gun regimes in the context of access to firearms by those suffering from mental illness and who pose a threat of parasuicide or suicide. Consideration is given to experiences in other jurisdictions and international research on firearm suicide prevention.

Few studies have focused on the caliber of weapon or long term trends in weapon use. We designed a retrospective study to analyze firearm deaths occurring between 1982 and 2004, considering manner of death (homicide versus suicide), firearm type, and caliber of the weapon. We found that the homicides by firearm steadily declined during the study period, mirroring the overall homicide rate during this period, whereas suicide by firearm rate remained steady. Handguns were the most commonly used weapon for both homicides and suicides during the 22-year period examined. Overall, the .38/.357 and the .22 caliber were the most commonly used handguns. The rate of .357/.38 handgun usage in homicides declined sharply over the study period whereas the use of the 9mm rose steadily, overtaking the .38/.357 in the late 1990s. The use of small caliber handguns steadily decreased in both homicidal and suicidal shootings whereas the .380 and .45 caliber handguns steadily increased in both homicidal and suicidal shootings. © 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,"article; death; firearm; homicide; retrospective study; shoot; suicide; United States; weapon; classification; coroner; gunshot injury; human; mortality; statistics; Coroners and Medical Examiners; Firearms; Homicide; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Suicide; Texas; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249089104,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

Signs of shots through clothing have always been considered suspicious, raising presumptions of the presence of an abettor. Our report, based on a retrospective study of fatal suicidal firearm injuries from the years 1980 to 2007, points out that suicide victims only rarely remove clothing from the site of the future entry wound. The report covered 43 cases with fatal gunshot wounds in the area of the thorax, with only four persons (9%) removing the clothing present in the area of the subsequent self-inflicted wound. Defects present on the clothing of a victim cannot, therefore, be understood as an absolute criterion for disproving the possibility of suicide, and nor do they necessarily indicate an unfortunate accident or homicide. If, however, the suicide victim removes the clothing from the area of the future wound, then this is almost always an indication of suicide. © 2010 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Autopsy feature; Clothing; Forensic science; Gunshot wound; Homicide; Suicide,"alcohol; central depressant agent; article; blood; clothing; female; firearm; forensic pathology; gunshot injury; human; male; middle aged; pathology; suicide; thorax injury; gunshot injury; Central Nervous System Depressants; Clothing; Ethanol; Female; Firearms; Forensic Pathology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Suicide; Thoracic Injuries; Wounds, Gunshot; Central Nervous System Depressants; Clothing; Ethanol; Female; Firearms; Forensic Pathology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Suicide; Thoracic Injuries; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951104746,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

Devices and ammunition are available over the counter, age of consent (18 years) is the only legal restriction. Loaded with a 700 J cartridge the device is positioned in the vole passage. By slightly touching a metal ring in front of the muzzle the mouse triggers the shoot and is killed by a high-pressure gas jet. In spite of the high-potential danger causing injuries no study on accidents due to blank cartridge mouse shooters has been published yet. Methods: Patients suffering hand injuries due to vole captive bolt devices were identified. Both type and severity of injury and treatment were recorded. An assessment instrument was designed to identify the critical circumstances leading to injury. Also safety regulations and security measures were examined. Results: Between August 2004 and February 2007 20 male patients (average age 48.65 years) suffered accidental hand injuries due to vole captive bolt devices. Patterns of injury reached from cutaneous burning up to traumatic amputation of fingers and separation of the whole hand. In 9 of 20 cases an unintended shoot was triggered in secured status of the devices so the accidents were caused by failure of the security mechanism. Ballistic considerations, casualties and the injury pattern itself differ from well-studied hand injuries caused by blank cartridges or fireworks. Conclusion: The study presents a previously unpublished injury pattern due to vole captive bolt devices. Forensic approach has to keep in mind this previously unknown mechanism as cause of accident or self-mutilation. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Out of 17,250 autopsies performed at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Novi Sad during the 15-year period (1991-2005), 29 cases of suicides and two homicides were committed by captive-bolt pistols. Wounds inflicted by captive-bolt guns have specific morphological features, distinctive from wounds made by other kinds of hand firearms. Selected features of the captive-bolt wounds (punched round entrance and a double pattern of smoke soiling) depend on distance and angle of instrument at the time of firing. Autopsy findings were compared with an experimental model consisting of 20 domestic pigs. Obtained results confirmed that the appearance of the entrance hole and soot deposits, along with differences in shape, location, extent, and density of soot blackening, could be useful in identification of weapon, direction of discharge, shooting distance, and angle of the muzzle to the frontal and sagittal planes of the head at the moment of fire. © 2007 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","""humane killer""; Captive-bolt gun; Cranio-cerebral trauma; Forensic pathology; Forensic science; Gunshot","autopsy; conference paper; forensic pathology; gunshot injury; head injury; homicide; human; priority journal; suicide; Abattoirs; Animals; Forensic Pathology; Head Injuries, Penetrating; Homicide; Humans; Models, Animal; Suicide; Swine",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548316357,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

He was lying in a supine position on a carpet in the living room, with the stud gun stuck in his skull.

Without doing any changes to the barrel, using blank or tear gas cartridges, firing at contact range can cause penetration of gas into the body including bone originated from gunpowder. We report two suicide cases shooting themselves at temporal region with a blank cartridge gun at contact range. There was no foreign body on radiological examination and there was no trajectory of a bullet inside the brain. In both cases the wound was at the right temporal region and there was defect at temporal bone. There was circular soot around this bone defect. The injury of the brain tissue was localized at the level of the defect but there was widespread subarachnoidal bleeding.

After having triggered the explosion of the blank cartridge by touching a metal ring around the muzzle, the vole is killed by the massive propulsion of the gas jet. Improper use and recklessness while handling these devices may cause severe injuries with the hand of the operator at particular risk. Currently, there are no experimental investigations on the ballistic background of these devices. Methods: An experimental test set-up was designed for measurement of the firing pressure and the dynamic force of the gas jet of a vole captive bolt device. Therefore, a vole captive bolt device was prepared with a pressure take-off channel and a piezoelectric transducer for measurement of the firing pressure. For measurement of the dynamic impact force of the gas jet an annular quartz force sensor was installed on a test bench. Each three simultaneous measurements of the cartridges' firing pressure and the dynamic force of the blast wave were taken at various distances between muzzle and load washer. Results: The maximum gas pressure in the explosion chamber was up to 1100 bar. The shot development over time showed a typical gas pressure curve. Flow velocity of the gas jet was up to 2000 m/s. The maximum impact force of the gas jet at the target showed a strong inverse ratio to the muzzle's distance and was up to 11,500 N for the contact shot distance. Energy density of the gas jet for the close contact shot was far beyond the energy density required for skin penetration. Conclusion: The unique design features (short tube between cartridge mouth and muzzle and narrow diameter of the muzzle) of these gadgets are responsible for the high firing pressure, velocity and force of the gas jet. These findings explain the trauma mechanics of the extensive tissue damage observed in accidental shots of these devices. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This calibre is most often used in Kerner-type livestock stunners, but also in different power tools. The legal framework of these industrial blank cartridges is provided by the C.I.P. and DIN 7260 regulations. The aim of this investigation is to describe and compare two experimental test procedures for measurement of maximum gas pressure and kinetic energy of cal. 9 mm x 17 mm industrial blank cartridges according to standardized C.I.P. and DIN 7260 protocols and to provide these ballistic data. Using two different pressure measurement barrels and standardized test projectiles, the maximum gas pressure and the kinetic energy of the test projectiles are investigated. While the pressure take-off point in C.I.P. protocol is at the cartridge mouth, the DIN 7260 protocol is modified using a pressure take-off point in the cartridge chamber. For each test protocol (C.I.P. and DIN), maximum gas pressure, velocity, impulse and energy of the test projectiles are measured. Each ten cartridges from the same ammunition lot of four different energy levels (red, blue, yellow, green) are investigated. While the cartridge energy values are comparable between the two different test protocols, maximum gas pressure measured in the DIN set-up (3907 bar) far surpasses the gas pressure in the C.I.P. protocol (1586 bar). Both test protocols observed higher energy values of the green and yellow cartridges than regulated in DIN 7260. Enormous gas pressure values of more than 3900 bar emphasize the power of industrial blank cartridges. Once again, the harmlessness of these blank cartridges and the weapons/tools that are operated with these propellants is refuted.",,,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

Because they are cost-effective, are easily accessible and can be modified to live firearms plus their unclear legal situation in Turkish Law makes them very popular in Turkey. 2004 through 2008, a total of 1115 modified blank weapons were seized in Turkey. Blank firing weapons are easily modified by owners, making them suitable for discharging live firearm ammunition or modified blank ammunitions. Two common methods are used for modification of blank weapons. After the modification, these weapons can discharge the live ammunition. However, due to compositional durability problems with these types of weapons; the main trend is to use the modified blank ammunitions rather than live firearm ammunition fired from modified blank firing weapons. In this study, two types of modified blank weapons and two types of modified blank cartridges were tested on three different target models. Each of the models' shooting side was coated with 1.3 ± 2 mm thickness chrome tanned cowhide as a skin simulant. The first model was only coated with skin simulant. The second model was coated with skin simulant and 100% cotton police shirt. The third model was coated with skin simulant and jean denim. After the literature evaluation four high risky anatomic locations (the neck area; the eyes; the thorax area and inguinal area) were pointed out for the steel and lead projectiles are discharged from the modified blank weapons especially in close range (0-50 cm). The target models were designed for these anatomic locations. For the target models six Transparent Ballistic Candle blocks (TCB) were prepared and divided into two test groups. The first group tests were performed with lead projectiles and second group with steel projectile. The shortest penetration depth (lead projectile: 4.358 cm; steel projectile 8.032 cm) was recorded in the skin simulant and jean denim coated block for both groups. In both groups, the longest penetration depth (lead projectile: 6.434 cm; steel projectile 8.608 cm) was recorded in the only skin simulant coated block. And the penetration depth of skin simulant and 100% cotton police shirt coated model was 5.870 cm for lead projectile; 8.440 cm for steel projectile. According to penetration results, national and international legislations and production standards should be re-evaluated in order to prevent the modification of blank weapons and ammunitions.

We have examined cases submitted to the Aydin Regional Criminal Laboratory of Turkey in 2006. In total, 95 modified pistols and 300 modified cartridges were examined. The blank cartridge firing pistols are guns which look similar to ""real"" pistols, however, there are blockages in their barrel in order to prevent the discharge of a bullet. However, as a result of simple modifications, these pistols can be easily converted into ""real"" firearms. Studied modification methods are removing the obstruction from the barrel, removing the partial obstruction from the barrel, sleeving a smaller diameter tube into the original barrel, using a replacement barrel, and rifling the original barrel. Special cartridges for these modified pistols are also produced. These modified pistols and cartridges were evaluated in respect of the converting methods. © 2009 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Ballistics; Blank cartridge; Blank pistol; Forensic science; Modification/conversion methods; Obstruction,article; bullet; firearm; priority journal; Turkey (republic),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349188160,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

The present study was therefore carried out to improve understanding of the terminal ballistic behaviour of air rifle pellets. Pellets were fired into ballistic gel under a variety of conditions.The pellets penetrated further than anticipated from their low cross-sectional density, and Bloom number was not necessarily a good guide to gel behaviour. Pellet penetration into the gel decreased with increasing gel concentration, and appeared to be linear at higher concentrations. Pointed pellets penetrated up to 50% further than rounded pellets. Power and range affect penetration, but other factors are also important, and power alone is not a simple guide to potential penetration.Test firings were also carried out firing pellets into ballistic gel that contained sections of animal bone. Computed tomography (CT) and visual observation were employed to record the interactions. CT scanning showed potential as a tool for examining pellet damage. The bone appeared to be undamaged, but the pellets were severely deformed on impact. If the pellet strikes the bone at an angle, less energy is absorbed by the impact and the pellet fragments may ricochet and cause further damage in the gel. A tentative model is proposed for estimating the energy absorbed by the impact. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Air weapon; Ballistic gel; CT scan; Terminal ballistics; Tomography,"air rifle pellet; animal tissue; article; ballistics; bone; computer assisted tomography; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cow; density; energy; femur; forensic science; nonhuman; observation; priority journal; weapon; Animals; Cattle; Femur; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Gels; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953916837,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

The projectile penetrating the gelatine transfers energy and causes radial cracks according to the temporary cavity. Thus the crack length is a function of the energy spent in the medium. In practice the fissures are poorly contrasted for which reason an enhancement of contrast was searched.A series of six shoots with expanding bullets (9mm × 19 Action-5, 9mm × 19 Quick Defense 1, 5.56mm × 45 Styx Action) was realized on 10% gelatine blocks at 4°C temperature. Three blocks were marked with acryl paint on the front, three blocks were shot native. The blocks were cut in slices of 1. cm thickness and optically scanned. The evaluation was performed according to Fackler's wound profile, the total crack length method and the polygon method. The paint was soaked into the block by the collapse of the temporary cavity and transported with diminishing intensity to the end of the trajectory. Colour contrast was successfully realized in all the shots which made easier to measure the length of the fissures. The comparison of the shots with and without paint gave a better reproducibility of measures with colour contrast. Using paint the energy transfer began earlier so that the curve of the wound profile was shifted by 1. cm to the entry which is explicated by the paint pad put on the block. The maximum crack lengths did not significantly differ with and without paint. All evaluation methods profited from colour contrast but the total crack length method the most of all. Further experiments showed that colour contrast is also successful in 20% gelatine and is not dependent of the type of projectile. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Expanding bullet; Gelatine; Gunshot; Tissue simulant; Wound ballistics,acrylic acid; gelatin; article; ballistics; bullet; color; contrast enhancement; controlled study; physical parameters; priority journal; reproducibility; simulation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950299832,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

The devices create a loud noise while simultaneously propelling a hard foam dummy for retrieval. A newly developed dummy launcher is based on a modified cal. 9. mm P.A. blank handgun with an extension tube pinned and welded to the barrel imitation. Currently, there are no experimental investigations on the ballistic background and trauma potential of these uncommon shooting devices. Methods: An experimental test set-up consisting of a photoelectric infrared light barrier was used for measurement of the velocity of hard foam dummies propelled with an automatic dummy launcher.Ballistic parameters of the dummies and an aluminium sleeve as improvised projectile (kinetic energy (E), impulse (p), energy density (E') and threshold velocity (vtsh) to cause penetrating wounds as a function of cross-sectional density (S)) were calculated. Results: The average velocity (v) of the dummies was measured 25.71m/s exerting an average impulse (p) of 3.342Ns. The average kinetic energy (E) was calculated 43.04J with an average energy density (E') of 0.069J/mm2. The average velocity (v) of the aluminium sleeves as improvised projectiles was measured 79.58m/s exerting an average impulse (p) of 2.228Ns. The average kinetic energy (E) of the aluminium sleeves was calculated as 88.70J with an average energy density (E') of 0.282J/mm2. Conclusion: The energy delivered by these shooting devices is high enough to cause relevant injuries. The absence of skin penetration must not mislead the emergency physician or forensic expert into neglecting the potential damage from these devices. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Ballistics; Blank cartridges; Blunt force trauma; Power tool; Trauma mechanics,aluminum; article; ballistics; calculation; controlled study; density; energy; firearm; priority journal; skin penetration; velocity; wound,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953914990,,IFSMS 2010,Firearms,Firearms

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators. © 2009 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Eighty-one cases (15%) involved exclusion or limitation of identification evidence, with 50 (65.7%) of these failing to meet the ""reliability"" threshold.

The greater concern may be an examiner not familiar with these markings that relies on the gross characteristics alone for a positive identification. The Miami-Dade Police Department Crime Laboratory obtained 10 consecutively manufactured Glock EBIS Barrels to further explore the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions, as well as the capability of identifying bullets fired through consecutively manufactured Glock EBIS Barrels. On a voluntary basis, 150 test sets were created and distributed to laboratories in forty-four states and nine countries. The test set was designed to determine an examiner+s ability to correctly identify bullets fired from 10 consecutively manufactured EBIS Barrels to test fired bullets fired from the same barrels. Additionally, this empirical study established an error rate of 0.4 percent.","Enhanced Bullet Identification System (EBIS), error rate, Miami Barrel, National Academy of Sciences, polygonal, subclass",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

As a result, a firearms examiner can determine if these cartridges originate from the same production line, within a relatively short period of time. Although the toolmarks can be used as a supplemental analysis which increases the strength of the evidence, it cannot be used to prove that cartridge cases from a crime scene are the same as those found in subsequent searches of a suspect. As a result, a match of these marks merely increases the probability cartridges come from the same production line.

The surface topography of the SRM masters and the replicas were measured and compared to determine their topography similarity. The topography comparisons revealed surface contamination of a replica bullet made from the first SRM bullet master. However, the surface contamination problem was significantly improved with a replica bullet made from the second SRM bullet master. To compare the performance similarity of imaging correlations, one of the replica bullets was imaged at the National Laboratory Center of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) using an Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS)*. The image of the replica bullet was correlated with those of the SRM bullets previously tested from 2002 to 2006. The Max Phase correlation scores were used for performance comparisons.

In particular, the paper focuses on the application of 3D imaging and recording technology as applied to firearm identification, being a specialised field within the discipline of toolmark identification. Each technology under test employs a different technique or scientific principle to capture topographic data i.e. focus-variation microscopy, confocal microscopy, point laser profilometry and vertical scanning interferometry. To qualitatively establish the capabilities and limitations of each technology investigated, standard reference samples were used and a set of specific operational criteria devised for successful application in this field. The reference standard crucially included and centred on was the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 'standard bullet'. This was to ensure that evaluation represented the practical examination of ballistic samples i.e. fired cartridge cases and bullets. It is concluded that focus-variation microscopy has potentially the most promising approach for a forensic laboratory instrument, in terms of functionality and 3D imaging performance, and is worthy of further investigation.","3D imaging, bullet, cartridge case, confocal microscopy, firearms identification, focus-variation microscopy,forensic ballistics, laser triangulation, optical profilometry,point laser profilometry, striae, stylus profilometry, toolmarks",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

After image preprocessing, edge detection and filtering techniques are used to extract the edges of striation marks, the resulting binary image distinctly shows the amount and distribution of striation marks. Then striation density is calculated for determining the quality of images. In the experiment, striation densities for six lands of 48 bullets fired from 12 gun barrels of six manufactures are calculated.

The cross-correlation function plays an important role in matching the characteristic features on the cartridge case found at the crime scene with a specific firearm, for accurate firearm identification. This paper proposes that the computational forensic techniques of alignment and effective correlation area-based approaches to image matching are essential to firearm identification. Specifically, the reference and the corresponding cartridge cases are aligned according to the phase-correlation criterion on the transform domain. The informative segments of the breech face marks are identified by a cross-covariance coefficient using the coefficient value in a window located locally in the image space. The segments are then passed to the measurement of edge density for computing effective correlation areas. Experimental results on a new dataset show that the correlation system can make use of the best properties of alignment and effective correlation area-based approaches, and can attain significant improvement of image-correlation results, compared with the traditional image-matching methods for firearm identification, which employ cartridge-case samples. An analysis of image-alignment score matrices suggests that all translation and scaling parameters are estimated correctly, and contribute to the successful extraction of effective correlation areas. It was found that the proposed method has a high discriminant power, compared with the conventional correlator. This paper advocates that this method will enable forensic science to compile a large-scale image database to perform correlation of cartridge case bases, in order to identify firearms that involve pairwise alignments and comparisons. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Cartridge case image matching; Cross-correlation function; Edge density measurement; Effective correlation area; Firearm identification; Image registration,accuracy; article; ballistics; cartridge case image matching; firearm; forensic science; imaging system; priority journal,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886940336,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

An intermediate step in the solution of this problem is the segmentation of certain regions that are defined on the cartridge case base. This paper describes a model-based method that performs segmentation of the cartridge case using surface height image of a center fire cartridge case base. The proposed method detects the location of the cartridge case base center and specific circular contours around it iteratively by projecting the problem to a one-dimensional feature space. In addition, the firing pin impression region is determined by utilizing an adaptive threshold that differentiates impression marks form primer region surface. Letters on the cartridge case base are also detected by using surface modeling and adaptive thresholding, in order to render the surface comparison operation robust against irrelevant surface features.

Unknown bullets were identified to the barrels from which they had been fired using traditional comparison techniques. Each land impression (LI) was photographed, and the distances of the prominent striae to one shoulder of the (LI) were measured using computer software. Two methods of selecting measurable striae were used. The data from these measurements was then converted into a barcode representative of the LI from which it was taken. Barcodes were subjected to Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to evaluate the computer's ability to correctly identify which LI was represented by the barcode, based on SVM analysis error rate (ideal error rate ≤5%). Optimal error rate varied based on selection technique, with 19.444% and 1.149% being the optimal values obtained by each method.

The aim of this work was to develop a methodology to investigate the within- and betweenbatch variation in physical and mechanical properties of 9 x 19 mm full metal jacket (DM1 1A1B2) ammunition. The variation in properties is of interest for two reasons i) variability as a test piece because all UK Police body armour provides protection from it and ii) variability with respect to batch identification for recovered bullets and fragments of bullets, and / or cartridge cases. In this work a selection protocol for sampling from batches of ammunition was developed and tested. Non-destructive and destructive techniques were investigated for determining the variability of ammunition from two batches. Data obtained were statistically analysed. XRF of the bullet core was a good technique for determining variability between batches, but required the bullet to be sectioned, or to have fragmented. Measuring the length of the whole round and its mass was the most useful method with respect to minimising variability of ammunition as a test piece.Buy Journal (non-members) Buy this Article ($5) (non-members)Members login to view.","dimensions, mass, X-ray fluorescence, body armour, bullet, cartridge case",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

It was important to the facts of the case to determine whether the bullet was 9mm Luger or 357 SIG caliber. While most of the discernable class characteristics of the questioned bullet were very similar to commonly produced bullets of both calibers, it was determined that the position of the cartridge case crimp mark relative to the base of the bullet could be used as a discriminating factor to help determine which of the two types of cartridges it had been fired from. Due to the longer case length of 357 SIG cartridges compared to 9mm Luger cartridges and the similar overall length of both cartridges, the corresponding cartridge case crimp mark on 357 SIG bullets will be located farther from the base than those on 9mm bullets.

Typically, for certification, consistency of bullets is assumed. Therefore, practical variations in bullet jacket dimensions can have far reaching consequences. Traditionally, internal dimensions could only be analysed by cutting bullets which rules out any subsequent ballistic assessment. Therefore, the use of a non-destructive X-ray computed tomography (CT) method is explored in this paper. A set of 10 bullets (9 mm DM11) was taken for analysing both intra and inter bullet jacket thickness variation. CT measurements of jacket thickness were validated with high resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. An image based analysis methodology has been developed to extract the jacket thickness map and the centre of gravity. Thickness variations of the order of 200 μm were found commonly across all the bullets along the length and an angular variation of up to 100 μm was found in a few bullets. Jacket thickness and centre of gravity were also calculated for the same bullets after impact and the variations between the pre- and post-impacted bullets were compared, by establishing a common physical reference. The results show that the proposed CT scanning approach and subsequent image analysis method can bring out the statistical variations in bullet geometry pre- and post impact effectively.",X-ray computed tomography; Bullet geometry; Jacket thickness; Armour standards,,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

In this study; the effect of the new legislation on the use of blank cartridge firing guns in crimes and their forensic examination is discussed. It has been found that after the new Act was accepted in 2008 the number of converted and unconverted blank cartridge firing pistols which had been used in crime and subsequently examined in criminal laboratories had reduced.

Lawrence, Forensic Scientist, Firearms and Toolmarks Unit, Physical Sciences Section, Centre of Forensic Sciences, Toronto, Ontario and Holly Lee, Under Graduate Student, University of Toronto, Mississauga, Ontario","As defined by the Association of Firearms and Toolmark Examiners, trigger pull is the amount of force which must be applied to the trigger of a firearm to cause sear release. The frequency at which trigger pulls are featured in investigations of accidental discharge of a firearm has stimulated the development of trigger pull databases. These databases allow the firearms examiner to easily search and compare test values with those of other weapons of the same make, model, and caliber. Traditionally, trigger pulls have been conducted by applying the pulling force on the trigger parallel to the bore axis of the long gun. However, the design of some long guns results in the shooter assuming a natural grip and exerting a trigger pull at an upward angle of 20-30 degrees to the bore axis. The question of whether trigger pulls should be conducted parallel or at an angle to the bore axis was studied by examining the geometry of the pulling force applied on the trigger. It was hypothesized that the latter method would generate higher values due to the imposed angle on trigger movement. A series of trigger pulls were measured by pulling both parallel to the bore and at an angle for each long gun.The magnitude of the readings depended upon the trigger design and not the angle at which force is applied to the trigger. Specifically, the location of the applied force relative to the trigger+s axis of rotation and the direction of the trigger rotation were the factors which determined the magnitude of the trigger pull force. Since there is a potential for a significant difference in trigger pulls conducted parallel to the bore as opposed to at a natural angle, it is recommended that both trigger pull methods be used in casework.","angle trigger pull, natural grip, pistol grip, parallel trigger pull",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

Box 5347 Carefree, AZ 85377 and Alexander Jason, ANITE Group, P.O. Box 375, Pinole, CA 94564","Drywall, also known as sheetrock and wallboard, is common in homes and offices as a means of constructing interior walls. The product comes in several popular thicknesses and consists of pressed, semi-hydrous gypsum covered with a heavy paper layer on both surfaces. Popular thicknesses in the United States are 1/2-inch (12.7mm) and 5/8-inch (15.9mm). A much less common thickness of 3/8-inch (9.5mm) is also available. Once nailed onto the supporting structures, the nails and joints are usually covered and the exposed surface painted or covered with wallpaper. Drywall is often struck and perforated by bullets discharged in shootings that occur indoors. The velocity necessary for medium caliber pistol bullets to perforate common drywall is relatively low- on the order of 100 to 170f/s (30-52m/s) depending on the weight of the bullet and its orientation at the moment of impact. The velocity loss experienced by such bullets during the penetration and perforation process is also quite low and on the order of 40 to 50f/s (12-15m/s) for common +-inch thick drywall. Bullet deflection as a consequence of perforation is virtually non-existent making the reconstruction of a bullet's preimpact flight path from the entry hole and a subsequent downrange impact point very reliable. The ejection of displaced calcium sulfate from the exit side of a panel of drywall takes place along a path that is orthogonal to the bullet's exit site and not necessarily according to the flight path of the bullet. This dislodged material may be found adhering to a nearby opposing surface within the struck wall and can lead to serious errors in reconstructing the flight path of a shot into such a wall if it is used for that purpose.","Chronograph, Doppler radar, drywall, kinetic energy loss, penetration, perforation, Perma-Gel, sheetrock, terminal ballistics, threshold velocity, velocity loss, wallboard",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

This is both counter-intuitive and a potential source of serious error in the evaluation and reconstruction of shooting incidents involving shots through glass such as windshields, vehicle side windows and windows in buildings. The flight path of the ejected glass fragments is, however, predictable and is dictated by the orientation of the plane of the glass opposite the projectile+s impact site. In all cases, these expelled glass particles have considerable velocity and can produce downrange deposits and even damage on a variety of surfaces. They can also produce pseudo-stippling of the skin in individuals located downrange of bullet-struck glass and near the projectile+s exit site. The distribution and location of such pseudo-stippling and its relationship to the associated bullet hole in glass have important reconstructive value.","bullets, glass, glass fragments, orthogonal impact, non-orthogonal impact, penetration, perforation, projectiles, pseudo-stippling",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

Box 5347, Carefree, AZ 85377 & Alexander Jason, ANITE Group, P.O. Box 375, Pinole, CA 94564","Certain terminal ballistic events at shooting scenes result in situations where no recognizable bullets or fragments recognizable as having come from a bullet survive despite obvious bullet damage at the scene. This is a consequence of the very high decelerative forces exerted on bullets that encounter hard, unyielding surfaces during essentially orthogonal impacts. This can occur with both jacketed bullets possessing lead cores and plain lead bullets. Caliber and bullet weight are not a factor in the outcome; lead air rifle pellets through .50-caliber lead bullets all performed similarly once the impact velocity exceeded approximately 600 feet per second. A frame by frame study of bullet impacts with a hard, unyielding target via high speed videography allowed the average decelerative force acting on each bullet to be calculated. The results of this study have important forensic value in explaining the absence of recognizable bullets and/or bullet fragments at certain shooting scenes. Conversely, the presence of recognizable bullets or bullet fragments at a scene involving essentially orthogonal impacts with hard, unyielding surfaces is a clear indicator that these items struck the particular medium at a relatively low velocity.

Attention has been focused on the kinematics during deformation and destruction as well as determination of the relationship between bullet terminal parameters and impact velocity. The main results may be summarized as follows: 1. It has been shown that the bullet terminal shape can be defined by Common Terminal Shape (CTS) and by Specific Terminal Shape (STS). The CTS is not dependant on the impact velocity. 2. The bullet terminal length decreases with impact velocity according to equation (4) and the bullet terminal diameter increases with impact velocity according to equation (6). 3. The influence of strain e on impact velocity is described for lead bullets by equations (8), (9), and for full metal jacketed bullets by equations (10) and (11). 4. Each type and caliber of bullet has an Upper Limit of Dynamic Resistance (ULDRes), which can be determined by the energy for its adiabatic destruction, by equation (12). 5.

The task is usually approached working under the assumption that the entire distribution of pellets is available for examination.

The problem can be solved with reasonable accuracy when there are areas of void in the victim that are adjacent to the area struck by pellets. This study presents a method that can be used in precisely this type of situation, allowing the estimation of shot distance in cases of partial pellet patterns. It is based on collecting distributions in test shots at several distances, and taking samples in the targets, constrained by the shape of the void and the pellet hit areas. Statistical descriptors of patterns are extracted from such samples, and fed into a neural network classifier, estimating shot ranges of distance. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Neural networks; Pellets pattern; Shot distance,algorithm; article; artificial neural network; density; forensic science; gunshot injury; homicide; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; parameters; partial pellet pattern; physical anthropology; priority journal,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865658467,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

The examination of traces of foreign material embedded in or adhered to bullets provides critical information in the trajectory reconstruction of spent bullets. Such a reconstruction can have considerable legal implications because it can prove that it was not someone's intention to kill. However, the microtraces that remain on spent bullets are often ignored. Microtraces on bullets, around bullet-holes and on ricochet marks were investigated using SEM/EDX for two different types of bullets: a relatively hard, full metal jacket (FMJ) bullet and a relatively soft, lead round-nose (LRN) bullet. A total of 179 bullets were fired into intermediate targets, sheets of 5 different materials (MDF, greenboard, gypsum fibreboard, glass and steel), at approximate incident angles of 90°, 10° and 5°. Of the 144 bullets fired at incident angles of 90°, 130 bullets perforated one of the materials, and 14 bullets perforated two of the materials. The 35 bullets fired at incident angles of 10° and 5° ricocheted off the intermediate targets, producing ricochet marks. In the majority of cases, traces from the target materials were found on the bullet, both after perforation and ricochet. The only exceptions were (1) the perforation of 9-mm sheets of MDF by FMJ bullets and (2) ricochet off glass when the glass did not break. Steel targets transfer small, but still detectable traces of iron to the bullet. The order in which targets are hit was reflected in the traces found on the bullets, i.e., materials from a secondary target were deposited on top of deposits from the primary target. This result implies that it is possible to determine the order of impact from the stratification of the material analysed. Traces from the bullets were found around all the bullet holes. Wipe-off from lead bullets is sometimes visible by the naked eye. Ricocheting bullets produce remarkable traces on glass. The combination of sliding and flattening action leaves a trace of the bullet's surface material in the form of tiny droplets and other evidence of liquid formation. In general, softer LRN bullets are more susceptible to the transfer of material than harder FMJ bullets. For perforation, trace materials are preferentially deposited in a ring-shaped area around the (flattened or unflattened) nose of the bullet. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Ballistics; Bullets; Microscopy; Microtraces; SEM/EDX,article; ballistics; bullet; firearm; forensic identification; legal evidence; materials handling; materials testing; particle size; physical chemistry; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; X ray,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870299089,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

Haag, Forensic Science Services, Carefree, AZ and Mahesh Patel, Forensic Analysis Consulting Services, Scottsdale, AZ","The matter of bone particles embedded in a recovered bullet can be the most important and significant finding in certain cases. The recognition of bone particles adhering to, or embedded in bullets based on the physical appearance of bone particles under the stereomicroscope is a readily acquired skill for firearm examiners who regularly examine bullets from gunshot victims. While there is little doubt that experienced firearm examiners can correctly identify bone particles by visual inspection, such opinions are clearly subjective and totally experience-based. As such they are subject to attack and challenge on this basis by those whose theory of the shooting incident stands to be disproved by the presence of bone particles embedded in an evidence bullet. Moreover, there may be cases where the suspected bone particles are too small to allow their customary physical properties and attributes to be adequately seen under the stereomicroscope.This article describes the physical properties and attributes of bone particles observable during an examination of evidence bullets followed by the ability of SEM-EDS analysis, polarized light microscopy and/or magnetic levitation to discriminate bone particles from any other mineral or material with which they might otherwise be confused.","apatite, bone, calcium phosphate, collagen, fluorine, polarized light microscopy, magnetic levitation, PLM, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometry, SEM-EDS, shooting reconstruction, squish test, trace evidence, wound ballistics",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

Development of the surrogate involved simulating the various layers of the skin and underlying soft tissues using a combination of materials. A standardized 12-gauge impactor was used to assess each combination. The energy density that resulted in a 50% risk of penetration for the anterior thorax region (23.99J/cm2) from the previous research was matched using a specific combination of layers. Twelve various combinations of materials were tested with the 50% risk of penetration determined.

Visual quantitative TCL analysis of cut slices in ordnance gelatine blocks is unreliable due to the poor visibility of cracks and the likely introduction of secondary cracks resulting from slicing. Furthermore, gelatine TCL patterns are difficult to preserve because of the deterioration of the internal structures of gelatine with age and the tendency of gelatine to decompose. By contrast, using computed tomography (CT) software for TCL analysis in gelatine, cracks on 1-cm thick slices can be easily detected, measured and preserved. In this, experiment CT TCL analyses were applied to gunshots fired into gelatine blocks by three different ammunition types (9-mm Luger full metal jacket, .44 Remington Magnum semi-jacketed hollow point and 7.62×51 RWS Cone-Point). The resulting TCL curves reflected the three projectiles' capacity to transfer energy to the surrounding tissue very accurately and showed clearly the typical energy transfer differences. We believe that CT is a useful tool in evaluating gunshot wound profiles using the TCL method and is indeed superior to conventional methods applying physical slicing of the gelatine. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",CT; Forensic imaging; Gunshot energy; Ordnance gelatine; Total crack length measurement; Virtopsy,"article; audiovisual equipment; ballistics; computer assisted tomography; gunshot injury; human; methodology; radiography; Forensic Ballistics; Humans; Models, Anatomic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651234743,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

Canadian courts have accepted the forensically established criteria of ""penetration or rupture of an eye"" as serious bodily injury. The minimal velocity of nonconventional ammunition required to penetrate the eye including airsoft projectiles has yet to be established. To establish minimal threshold requirements for eye penetration, empirical tests were conducted using a variety of airsoft projectiles. Using the data obtained from these tests, and previous research using ""air gun"" projectiles, an ""energy density"" parameter was calculated for the minimum penetration threshold of an eye. Airsoft guns capable of achieving velocities in excess of 99 m/s (325 ft/s) using conventional 6-mm airsoft ammunition will satisfy the forensically established criteria of ""serious bodily injury."" The energy density parameter for typical 6-mm plastic airsoft projectiles is 4.3 to 4.8 J/cm. This calculation also encompasses 4.5-mm steel BBs.

Previous studies of contact wounds have shown variability in the potential of these weapons to produce bursting wounds of the head. The present study analyzed contact head wounds owing to 26 centerfire rifles and nine shotgun slugs and compared them with respect to weapon, ammunition, entry wound site, and projectile kinetic energy. The bursting effect, defined for this study as disruption of at least 50% of the head, occurred in 25/35 of cases and was related to kinetic energy. Bursting was associated with energies <2700 ft-lbs in 12/22 cases and energies >2700 ft-lbs in 13/13 cases. The volume of gunpowder gas injected into the wound was considered as contributing to the bursting phenomenon. There was no relation of bursting to the specific entrance wound site, type of ammunition, or projectile fragmentation. © 2012 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Centerfire rifles; Contact firearm wounds; Forensic pathology; Forensic science; Head bursting; Kinetic energy; Krönlein shot; Lead snowstorm; Shotgun slugs,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872382672,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

Wound ballistic experiments were performed to clarify whether muzzle gases from the firearm have an additional wounding potential. Methods Fifteen head models were prepared as follows: an acryl sphere measuring 14 cm in diameter was completely covered with a layer of silicon that was 3 mm thick. These spheres were filled with 10% gelatine. At 4°C, these models were fired at with a 9-mm Luger pistol, loaded with Quick Defense 1 expanding bullets. Five shots were fired with direct muzzle contact, one shot was fired from a distance of 10 cm, four shots were fired from a distance of 2 m, and five shots were fired from a distance of 4 m. Results Each projectile penetrated the model; all but one projectile deformed regularly. Each acryl sphere shattered into comminuted pieces but was held together by the silicon cover. The gelatine filling was then cut into slices 1 cm thick, and each slice was optically scanned. An evaluation was performed following both Fackler's Wound Profile method and the polygon procedure method. The pattern of gelatine disruption did not differ in shots from intermediate ranges, but the amount of gelatine destruction was always more extended in the case of muzzle contact shots. Depending on the section of the bullet path, crack lengths were 31% to 133% longer in contact shots. The first centimetre and the second half of the bullet path showed the greatest increase. Conclusion The experimental findings prove the wounding capacity of muzzle gases. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Craniocerebral injury; Gunshot wound; Head model; Suicide,"gelatin; article; ballistics; biological model; gunshot injury; head injury; human; methodology; pathology; suicide; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Head Injuries, Penetrating; Humans; Models, Biological; Suicide; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863724637,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

Up to now, the pertinent literature places particular emphasis on the absence of indirect lesions away from the impact point, when dealing with the wounding capacity of slaughterer's guns. The recent observation of two suicidal head injuries accompanied by skull fractures far away from the bolt's path gave occasion to experimental studies using simulants (glycerin soap, balls from gelatin) and skull-brain models. As far as ballistic soap was concerned, the dimensions of the bolt's channel were assessed by multi-slice computed tomography before cutting the blocks open. The test shots to gelatin balls and to skull-brain models were documented by means of a high-speed motion camera. As expected, the typical temporary cavity effect of bullets fired from conventional guns could not be observed when captive bolt stunners were discharged.

There are countless reports on both accidental and intentional injuries and fatalities caused by these tools in medical literature. While the ballistic parameters of socalled low-velocity fastening tools, where the expanding gases act on a captive piston that drives the fastener into the material, are well known, ballistic parameters of ""highvelocity"" tools, which operate like a firearm and release the energy of the propellant directly on the fastener, are unknown. Therefore, it was the aim of this work to investigate external ballistic parameters of cal. 9 and 6- mm fastening bolts discharged from four different directacting nail guns (Type Ideal, Record Piccolo S, Rapid Hammer R300, Titan Type 1). Average muzzle velocity ranged from 400 to 580 m/s, while average kinetic energy of the projectiles ranged from 385 to 547 J. Mean energy density of the projectiles ranged from 9 to 18 J/mm2. To conclude, this work demonstrates that the muzzle velocity of direct-acting high-velocity tools is approximately five times higher than the muzzle velocity of piston-type tools. Hence, the much-cited comparison to the ballistic parameters of a cal. 22 handgun might be understated and a comparison to the widespread and well-known cal. 9 mm Luger might be more appropriate. © Springer-Verlag 2011.",Blank cartridge; Bolt setting gun; Nail gun; Penetrating injury; Trauma biomechanics,article; ballistics; building industry; equipment design; firearm; household; instrumentation; legal aspect; methodology; Construction Industry; Equipment Design; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Household Articles,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862989308,,IFSMS 2013,Firearms,Firearms

Failure to differentiate entry wound from exit wound can cause error in calculating number of projectiles entered into the body, lodged inside the body or exited through the body, besides posing problem in ascertaining direction of firing and direction of wound track etc. Failure to differentiate contact or close range firearm injury from distant range firearm injury can lead to wrong interpretation about the manner of death.

Radiological examination of the whole body, follow-up of the bullet trajectories, examination of the clothes, and examination of the gun and projectiles play a key role in solving difficult cases. We review such situations based on a case of tandem bullets.

However, in most cases, reporting does not take place, despite its vital importance in triggering the multidisciplinary intervention that will ensure the correct and timely diagnosis and protection of the victim. In the present case, the victim, a 37 year-old woman, was sexually and physically abused by her husband in their home, and was physically abused again at the victim's mother's house. The victim mentioned that her husband struck her in the head with a hammer and shot a handgun while in her mother's house. However, she denied having a gunshot wound. The couple's daughter was also slapped in the face by her father. The police took the victim to the emergency room of a central hospital to receive medical attention, while the medical examiner on duty was called to the same emergency room to perform a medico-legal evaluation in the context of the intimate partner violence reported to the police. Medico-legal assessment revealed scalp injuries that had not been detected during the first inspection by the emergency room attending physicians who had performed a neurological examination, which revealed no neurological dysfunction. A cranial computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstitution and virtual dissection, requested by the medical examiner, revealed two projectiles trapped in between the inner and the outer table of the cranium, with linear fractures only in the inner table and no brain injuries. Gynecological examination with the collection of biological evidence, also performed by the medical examiner, made it possible to identify a male DNA profile matching her husband's. The victim was subjected to neurosurgery and a follow-up, and was released one month after the traumatic event. A forensic psychological evaluation, performed one month after the traumatic event, revealed the presence of reactive symptoms to the occurrence. This multidisciplinary intervention and the use of modern diagnosis imaging techniques allowed for a timely diagnosis and treatment, adequate protection of the victim and her family, as well as the identification of the aggressor, who was arrested. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs.

For example, if a full single DNA profile for a contemporary marker system matching the profile of Mr A is assessed, given the propositions that the DNA came from Mr A and given it came from an unknown person, the strength of evidence can be overwhelming (e.g., in the order of a billion). In contrast, if we assess the same result given that the DNA came from Mr A and given it came from his twin brother (i.e., a person with the same DNA profile), the strength of evidence will be 1, and therefore neutral, unhelpful and irrelevant. 11Relevant evidence is defined here as any evidence that has the potential to alter one's view of the competing propositions of interest [1]. This use of the term 'relevance' is to be distinguished from 'relevance' as a descriptor of a trace's pertinence, that is the probability that it has been left by the offender [2]. to the case at hand. While this understanding is probably uncontroversial and obvious to most, if not all practitioners dealing with DNA evidence, the practical precept of not specifying an alternative source with the same characteristics as the one considered under the first proposition may be much less clear in other circumstances.During discussions with colleagues and trainees, cases have come to our attention where forensic scientists have difficulty with the formulation of propositions. It is particularly common to observe that results (e.g., observations) are included in the propositions, whereas-as argued throughout this note-they should not be. A typical example could be a case where a shoe-mark with a logo and the general pattern characteristics of a Nike Air Jordan shoe is found at the scene of a crime. A Nike Air Jordan shoe is then seized at Mr A's house and control prints of this shoe compared to the mark. The results (e.g., a trace with this general pattern and acquired characteristics corresponding to the sole of Mr A's shoe) are then evaluated given the propositions 'The mark was left by Mr A's Nike Air Jordan shoe-sole' and 'The mark was left by an unknown Nike Air Jordan shoe'. As a consequence, the footwear examiner will not evaluate part of the observations (i.e., the mark presents the general pattern of a Nike Air Jordan) whereas they can be highly informative. Such examples can be found in all forensic disciplines.In this article, we present a few such examples and discuss aspects that will help forensic scientists with the formulation of propositions. In particular, we emphasise on the usefulness of notation to distinguish results that forensic scientists should evaluate from case information that the Court will evaluate. © 2015 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences.",Evaluation; Evidence; Information; Interpretation; Likelihood ratio; Propositions,DNA; Article; bullet; case report; court; human; male; scientist; shoe; decision making; forensic science; problem solving; procedures; Decision Making; Forensic Sciences; Humans; Problem Solving,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945572114,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

However, the progress towards more widespread consensus about foundational principles is still fragile as it raises new problems about which views differ. It is not uncommon e.g. to encounter scientists who feel the need to compute the probability distribution of a given expression of evidential value (i.e. a BF), or to place intervals or significance probabilities on such a quantity. The article here presents arguments to show that such views involve a misconception of principles and abuse of language. The conclusion of the discussion is that, in a given case at hand, forensic scientists ought to offer to a court of justice a given single value for the BF, rather than an expression based on a distribution over a range of values. © The Author [2015].",Bayes factor; Estimation; Likelihood ratio; Probability; Uncertainty; Vari,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988410922,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

(2016) discuss the controversial issue of parameter uncertainty in the context of forensic evidence evaluation. Although we share with the authors the main idea that the likelihood ratio (LR) framework is the best method for evaluating forensic evidence, we have a different view on this issue. The core question is: does itmake sense to consider the uncertainty attached to a calculated value of the LR, and consequently, should we report a single value for the LR or in addition address its uncertainty? Taroni et al. (2016) argue for reporting a single value based on a 'full-Bayesian' approach, and accuse anyone who considers the uncertainty of an LR of 'misconception of basic principles' and 'abuse of language'. However, their arguments presented as facts or logic are in fact choices or opinions. Furthermore, reporting a single number for the LR deprives the legal justice system of essential information needed to assess the reliability of the evidence. Therefore, we argue that forensic scientists should not only report an LR value, but also address its uncertainty and we explain why this is not a misconception or abuse of language. © The Author [2015].",Bayes factor; Estimation; Evidential value; Forensic science; Likelihood ratio; Reliability; Uncertainty,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978926060,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

The data are based on within-expert comparisons, whereby the same expert unknowingly makes judgments on the same data at different times. This allows us to take robust measurements and conduct analyses that compare variances within the same experts, and thus to carefully quantify the degree of consistency and objectivity that underlie expert performance and decision making. To achieve consistency, experts must be reliable, at least in the very basic sense that an expert makes the same decision when the same data are presented in the same circumstances, and thus be consistent with themselves. To achieve objectivity, experts must focus only on the data and ignore irrelevant information, and thus be unbiasable by extraneous context. The analyses show that experts are not totally reliable nor are they unbiasable.

Cognitive insights provide relatively simply practical solutions to minimize bias by increasing examiners’ independence of mind. These derive from understanding the spectrum of biases—not only those that can arise from knowing irrelevant case information, but also biases that emerge from base rate regularities, working ‘backwards’ from the suspect to the evidence, and from the working environment itself. Cognitive science’s contribution to forensic work goes beyond fighting bias, it suggests ways to enhance examiners’ work with technology (distributed cognition), as well as how best to select candidates during recruitment. Taking human cognition into account, such as with a triage approach and case managers, can enhance the quality and effectiveness of the work carried out by forensic examiners. This paper details practical solutions that emerge from a cognitive perspective that understand human expertise and performance.

Within the discipline of forensic firearms examination, a procedure has been developed and implemented that minimizes the effects of domain-irrelevant information and maximizes the utilization of domain-relevant information. This procedure, termed context management, is described and for this we distinguish between different types of contextual information that an examiner may come across. Contextual information may come from the trace (Level 1), the reference material (Level 2), the case information (Level 3), and the “base rate” information (Level 4) [Stoel, R., Berger, C., Kerkhoff, W., Mattijssen, E.J.A.T. & Dror, I.

The foundation of firearm and tool mark identification is that each firearm/tool produces a signature of identification (striation/impression) that is unique to that firearm/tool, and through the examination of the individual striations/impressions, the signature can be positively identified to the firearm/tool that produced it. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report questioned the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions left on fired evidence as well as the validity and error rate in firearms identification. This study analyzed the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions on fired cartridge cases fired in 10 consecutively manufactured Ruger slides by analyzing breech face striations/impressions through an evaluation of the participants' accuracy in making correct identifications. One semi-automatic pistol and nine additional consecutively manufactured slides were utilized. Consecutively manufactured slides are significant to this study because they were manufactured with the same equipment/tools. Even though these slides were consecutively made, their signatures should be different. Test sets assembled included test fired casings from each slide, as well as unknowns. Participants were firearm & tool mark examiners throughout the United States. One hundred and fifty-eight test sets were distributed to laboratories in forty-six states and the District of Columbia. The test sets were designed to determine an examiner's ability to correctly identify cartridge casings fired from 10 consecutively manufactured Ruger Slides to test fired cartridge casings fired from the same slides. This empirical study established an error rate of less than 0.1 percent. Durability testing established that the Ruger Slides maintained their individual signature after multiple firings.

Based on the information gathered through research and during firearm manufacturer tours, broaching was used as the primary machining process and the effect of vibratory finishing on broaching marks as a function of time was examined. Vibratory finishing as a function of time did have a significant impact upon the individual markings caused by broaching. The finer, individual stria were removed as finishing time increased causing the grosser, individual marks to appear more pronounced. Subclass characteristics would then also appear more pronounced.

The application of a choke resulted in more obvious bullet elongation compared to a smoothbore barrel. The restriction caused merging of lands and groves of the imparted rifling and obscured their usual definition. Effects of breech adaption were also characterised by observing the buckling and enlargement of the cartridge case. This deformity of the cartridge case was most evident when the barrel pressure increased due to the presence of the choke. From this study it was evident that unique characteristic impressions associated with different modifications most commonly found in criminal investigations can be utilised by a forensic expert and impart significant intelligence to an investigation. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Barrel modifications; Bullet striations; Forensic countermeasures,awareness; ballistics; bullet; crime; firearm; forensic identification; microscopy; pressure; priority journal; Review; safety; velocity,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939490027,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

The concept of frangible ammunition is that it is designed to break up into non-hazardous fragments on impact with a metal target and has the benefits of being lead free, creating a safer and more easily maintained training environment. The purpose of this research project was a twofold evaluation of contemporary frangible ammunition. First, a study was conducted to determine the effects, if any, frangible ammunition had on the rifling characteristics of a gun barrel. Secondly, frangible ammunition was recovered after being fired at several target materials to determine if the fractured pieces were of any value for examination. The use of the frangible ammunition changed the working surface of the barret of one of the evaluated firearms such that the striae were altered. Surprisingly, intact and potentially identifiable frangible bullets were recovered after being fired through the target materials. © 2015, AFTF Journal.

This case study is one of those instances and was a technically challenging forensic firearms investigation from a number of perspectives. The firearms evidence was key to understanding what had occurred, primarily hinging on the interpretation of various toolmarks left on a .22 calibre fatal bullet. The toolmarks included those left by the bore but more importantly also comprised three other extraordinary marks, all occurring by totally separate processes during loading by the use of an aftermarket magazine in conjunction with the exhibit sawn off rifle. This article focuses mainly on the interpretation of these marks, how the marks were inter-related and the philosophy of identification.

One of these criticisms is that the forensic science community, and the field of firearm and tool mark examination in particular, has not done enough to control bias in empirical research, such as participating in blind testing. Numerous examples of firearm and too! mark validation studies can be found in the relevant scientific literature. Many of these are single-blind studies involving the use of consecutively manufactured tools.

Unknown bullets were identified to the barrels from which they had been fired using traditional comparison techniques. Each land impression (LI) was photographed, and the distances of the prominent striae to one shoulder of the (LI) were measured using computer software. Two methods of selecting measurable striae were used. The data from these measurements was then converted into a barcode representative of the LI from which it was taken. Barcodes were subjected to Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to evaluate the computer's ability to correctly identify which LI was represented by the barcode, based on SVM analysis error rate (ideal error rate ≤5%). Optimal error rate varied based on selection technique, with 19.444% and 1.149% being the optimal values obtained by each method.

Although the science behind these analyses has undergone rigorous testing and has been accepted in courts for many years, the science has recently been the subject of a great deal of scrutiny. In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report “Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward” called to question the legitimacy of the comparative sciences. Specifically, the NAS report states that the science of firearm and tool mark analysis lacks empirical research, has not been validated, and suffers from bias and subjectivity [1]. Extensive review of the literature has shown that the science has been validated and subjected to empirical research [2-4], but the need for adding an objective criterion exists, which will also help to minimize bias. The Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences (ADFS) has procured a confocal microscope for the purpose of incorporating three-dimensional (3D) topographical analysis into routine casework. The purpose of employing such a technique would be to assist the examiner by complementing routine analysis with an independent objective analysis.

The technologies developed offer opportunities to improve forensic toolmark identification. Toolmarks are created when a hard surface, the tool, comes into contact with a softer surface and causes plastic deformation. Toolmarks are commonly found on fired bullets and cartridge cases. Trained firearms examiners use these toolmarks to link an evidence bullet or cartridge case to a specific firearm, which can lead to a criminal conviction. Currently, identification is typically based on qualitative visual comparison by a trained examiner using a comparison microscope. In 2009, a report by the National Academies called this method into question. Amongst other issues, they questioned the objectivity of visual toolmark identification by firearms examiners. The National Academies recommended the development of objective toolmark identification criteria and confidence limits. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have applied its experience in surface metrology to develop objective identification criteria, measurement methods, and reference artefacts for toolmark identification. NIST developed the Standard Reference Material SRM 2460 standard bullet and SRM 2461 standard cartridge case to facilitate quality control and traceability of identifications performed in crime laboratories. Objectivity is improved through measurement of surface topography and application of unambiguous surface similarity metrics, such as the maximum value (ACCFMAX) of the areal cross correlation function. Case studies were performed on consecutively manufactured tools, such as gun barrels and breech faces, to demonstrate that, even in this worst case scenario, all the tested tools imparted unique surface topographies that were identifiable. These studies provide scientific support for toolmark evidence admissibility in criminal court cases.",Cross correlation function; Forensics; Toolmarks,Crime; Laboratories; Projectiles; Units of measurement; Cross-correlation function; Firearm identification; Forensics; Identification criterion; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Objective identification; Standard reference material; Toolmarks; Surface topography,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962802262,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

The NBIS will use three-dimensional (3D) topography measurements for ballistics identification and evidence searches. The 3D topographies will be subdivided into arrays of correlation cells in order to help identify ""valid correlation areas"" and eliminate ""invalid correlation areas"" from he matching and identification procedure. ""Synchronous processing"" is proposed for correlating dozens or even hundreds of cell pairs at the same time. Based on the concept of correlation cells, a ""Contiguous Matching Cells (CMC)"" method using three identification parameters of the paired correlation cells (cross correlation function maximum CCFmax, spatial registration position in x-y and registration angle θ) is proposed for high accuracy ballistics identifications. Based on the proposed CMC method, a ""National Ballistics Evidence Search Engine (NBESE)"" is also proposed for fast and accurate ballistics evidence searches. The proposed NBIS and NBESE can be used for correlations of both geometrical topographies and optical intensity images, and can be potentially applied for all case scenarios of fired bullets, cartridge cases and toolmarks. All the parameters and algorithms will be in the public domain and subject to open tests. An error rate reporting procedure will be developed that can greatly add to the scientific support for the firearm and toolmark identification specialty, and give confidence to the trier of fact in court proceedings. Both the NBIS and NBESE will be engineered to employ publicly available software and database file protocols, and provide published search algorithms and statistical models. In this way interoperability between different ballistics identification systems using this invention can be more easily achieved. This interoperability will make the NBIS and NBESE suitable for ballistics identifications and evidence searches with large national databases, such as those of the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) in the United States, as well as national databases in the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI).",Ballistics evidence search; Ballistics identification; CMC; Contiguous matching cells; Correlation cells; NBESE; NBIS; NIBIN; NIST; Synchronous processing,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887100099,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

The Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) method [2] uses three criteria to determine a pair of matching cells. These consist of a threshold for the cross correlation function maximum CCFmax, and a consistent pattern for registration angle θ and x-y registration position among matching pairs of cells. The number of congruent matching cell pairs C is determined by the three identification parameters associated with their thresholds [2]. Presently the proposed numerical identification criterion for identification is C ≥ 6. That is, two surfaces are identified as being fired by the same firearm if they contain at least six matching cell pairs [1, 2]. In order to test the CMC method and to verify the proposed numerical identification criterion, 40 cartridge cases fired from pistols with 10 consecutively manufactured slides are measured by a 3D confocal microscope and correlated by the CMC method. The breech face topographies are divided into cell arrays (7 × 7 or 6 × 6) for correlation. There are a total of 780 correlations comprising 63 known-matching (KM) and 717 known-non-matching (KNM). Initial tests support both the proposed CMC method and the numerical identification criterion C ≥ 6 for ballistics identifications. Test results show a significant separation between the KM and KNM distributions without any false positive or false negative identification. This represents the highest objective identification accuracy for the same set of cartridge cases that have been tested at NIST thus far. The identification accuracy can be further improved by optimization of the number of cells and the thresholds of the identification parameters, and registration algorithm.",Ballistics identification; Cartridge case; Congruent matching cells (CMC); Correlation cell; Identificationcriteria; Topography measurements,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887068927,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

We formulate an optimization problem that bases its matching decisions not only on the similarity between pairs of images, but also on the time and spatial location of each new acquisition and each database entry. The objective is to maximize the detection probability subject to a constraint on the false positive rate. We use data on all cartridge casings matches detected in Israel during 2006-2008 to estimate most of the model parameters. We estimate matching accuracy from two different studies and predict that the optimal use of extraneous information would increase the detection probability from 0.931 to 0.987 and from 0.707 to 0.844, respectively.

The success of these databases has led many to propose that all firearms in circulation be entered into a reference ballistic image database (RBID). To assess the performance of an RBID, we fired 4200 cartridge cases from 600 9mm Para Sig Sauer model P226 series pistols. Each pistol fired two Remington cartridges, one of which was imaged in the RBID, and five additional cartridges, consisting of Federal, Speer, Winchester, Wolf, and CCI brands. Randomly selected samples from the second series of Remington cartridge cases and from the five additional brands were then correlated against the RBID. Of the 32 cartridges of the same make correlated against the RBID, 72% ranked in the top 10 positions. Likewise, of the 160 cartridges of the five different brands correlated against the database, 21% ranked in the top 10 positions. Generally, the ranking position increased as the size of the RBID increased. We obtained similar results when we expanded the RBID to include firearms with the same class characteristics for breech face marks, firing pin impressions, and extractor marks. The results of our six queries against the RBID indicate that a reference ballistics image database of new guns is currently fraught with too many difficulties to be an effective and efficient law enforcement tool. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The performance of an RBID was investigated a decade ago by De Kinder et al. using IBIS® Heritage™ technology. The results of that study were published in this journal, issue 214. Since then, technologies have evolved quite significantly and novel apparatus have become available on the market. The current research article investigates the efficiency of another automated ballistic imaging system, Evofinder® using the same database as used by De Kinder et al. The results demonstrate a significant increase in correlation efficiency: 38% of all matches were on first position of the Evofinder correlation list in comparison to IBIS® Heritage™ where only 19% were on the first position. Average correlation times are comparable to the IBIS® Heritage™ system. While Evofinder® demonstrates specific improvement for mutually correlating different ammunition brands, ammunition dependence of the markings is still strongly influencing the correlation result because the markings may vary considerably. As a consequence a great deal of potential hits (36%) was still far down in the correlation lists (positions 31 and lower). The large database was used to examine the probability of finding a match as a function of correlation list verification. As an example, the RBID study on Evofinder® demonstrates that to find at least 90% of all potential matches, at least 43% of the items in the database need to be compared on screen and this for breech face markings and firing pin impression separately. These results, although a clear improvement to the original RBID study, indicate that the implementation of such a database should still not be considered nowadays. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Automated comparison; Ballistic database; Correlation; Evofinder; Firearms identification; Quality control,Article; automation; ballistics; computer system; firearm; forensic identification; imaging system; intermethod comparison; priority journal; process development; quality control; reference ballistic image database; reference database; reproducibility; system analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936931362,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

The method is based on the combination of digital images from the surfaces of a minimum of two fired (partly damaged) bullets. Land impressions containing marks of optimal quality for identification are selected and integrated by special software into a single Virtual Bullet. A Virtual Bullet (VB) is of higher quality than the original damaged bullets alone and can be used in computerized databases for successful comparison. The MSI method is applicable in the case of partly damaged bullets - evidence from crime scenes in particular. Virtual Bullets can be used to search for potential matches by means of comparative analysis using ballistic imaging technology.

Nevertheless, on some occasions, the bullet may be deformed to such extent that traditional investigation of striation marks will be impossible.Fragments of lead can be investigated by lead isotope ratio determination in order to distinguish between bullets with different origin. This approach initially seems reasonable, since the abundance of lead isotopes varies significantly in nature.To make a method valid for forensic purposes, it is important to have a fundamental understanding of the variation within a box of lead bullets and the expected variation between boxes. Studies of variability within and between boxes of ammunition are imperative to perform any type of forensic interpretation, both in an investigative and evaluative context.This work presents an extensive study of variability within and between boxes of ammunition by use of multicollector inductive coupled mass spectrometry. As a first approximation to classify bullets to any given source, a simple and robust graphical method is presented.

This study used a 30-year U.S. Supplementary Homicide Reports sample of SHOs arrested in single-victim situations (N=3745). The analysis strength was used to determine whether the findings yielded meaningful patterns for offender profiling. Several important findings emerged for the juvenile offenders. Juvenile White SHOs were likely to target victims with whom they shared a mutual relationship. In contrast, Black juveniles were equally likely to murder strangers and those with whom they had prior and familial relationships. Notably, no juvenile Black SHOs were arrested for murdering intimate partners. Juvenile White SHOs were twice as likely to use edged weapons as their Black counterparts.

With technological and manufacturing advancements over recent years, airguns in their many forms have become an active and rapidly growing segment for the recreational and professional user on an international basis. With increases in caliber selection, projectile velocities, and accuracy, performance differences between airguns and traditional firearms are rapidly narrowing and in some instances are indistinguishable. Accessory items such as muzzle protectors, compensators, and sound suppressors once found only on traditional firearms are now commonly marketed and used on airguns.

Results show that the critical angle differs depending on caliber and wood type. The critical angle is higher for .32 Auto bullets than for 9 mm Luger bullets and increases with increasing wood density and Janka hardness. The established critical angles for ricochet on the lightest and softest wood (Abachi) are 10.4° and 10.3° for .32 Auto and 9 mm Luger, respectively. For the heaviest and hardest wood (Ipe), the angles were 45.0° and 33.4°, respectively.

His method and the wood hardness scale which bears his name is primarily of value to companies and individuals associated with manufacture of furniture, wood flooring, and certain musical instruments. But, his method is not particularly useful for forensic scientists with a need to evaluate the hardness of various types and forms of wood encountered in casework. The method described here defines wood hardness on the basis of the impact velocity necessary to embed a standard 5.3-gr. (~0.34 g), 0.173-incli (4.39 mm) steel BB flush with the surface of the wood sample. The technique proposed provides a means of comparing specimens and verifying that any test specimens of wood selected for terminal ballistic testing are equivalent to the evidence wood. Such equivalency would be critical if bullet penetration depth or velocity loss as a consequence of projectile perforation were important in a case. This paper additionally describes application of this method in tests of bullet deflection by a specific species of tree branches. The species does not grow in the author's home state of Arizona, nor could a Janka hardness value he found for it. It was therefore deemed desirable to find a suitable local substitute of equal or slightly greater hardness for some additional deflection tests.

Two of these three shots struck President Kennedy. The bullet from one of these two shots also struck Texas Governor Connolly. Unaccounted for is the fate of the bullet from the missed shot, its order in the three shot sequence and its flight path. This article, the fourth in a series, presents a step-by-step review and analysis of the assassination, as well as the exterior and terminal ballistics of the 160-gr. 6.5mm WCC Carcano ammunition. This article concludes that the missing shot was the first shot fired, the bullet from this shot struck the asphalt of Elm Street at a relatively steep angle and subsequently self-destructed. © 2015, AFTE Journal.

Pathologists frequently have to give evidence in court, and may have their opinion about probable manner of death challenged or be questioned about how sure they can be. In the literature, the features are always discussed in isolation, but in practice, the pathologist has to consider such details in combination. Using pooled data from a systematic review to obtain large data sets, this study shows how Bayesian analysis can be applied to consideration of combined features and can thus provide a quantified degree of confidence to support the pathologist's opinion through the use of likelihood ratios.

The dominating cause of injuries in modern warfare is fragmentation and hence, this is the primary threat that military helmets protect the brain from. When helmets are perforated, this is usually by bullets. In combat, 20 % of penetrating injuries occur to the head and its wounding accounts for 50 % of combat deaths. A number of head simulants are described in the academic literature, in ballistic test methods for helmets (including measurement of behind helmet blunt trauma, BHBT) and in the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ government literature of several nations. The majority of these models are not anatomically correct and are not assessed with high-velocity rifle ammunition. In this article, an anatomically correct ‘skull’ (manufactured from polyurethane) and ‘brain’ (manufactured from 10 %, by mass, gelatine) model for use in military wound ballistic studies is described. Filling the cranium completely with gelatine resulted in a similar ‘skull’ fracture pattern as an anatomically correct ‘brain’ combined with a representation of cerebrospinal fluid. In particular, posterior cranial fossa and occipital fractures and brain ejection were observed. This pattern of injury compared favourably to reported case studies of actual incidents in the literature. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bullet; Helmet; High velocity; Penetrating; Rifle,"gelatin; polyurethan; audiovisual equipment; ballistics; gunshot injury; head injury; helmet; legislation and jurisprudence; pathophysiology; skull fracture; soldier; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Head Injuries, Closed; Head Injuries, Penetrating; Head Protective Devices; Manikins; Military Personnel; Polyurethanes; Skull Fractures; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928342274,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

This deformation may cause severe injuries without completely perforating the helmet, termed ""behind armor blunt trauma"" (BABT). As helmets become lighter, the likelihood of larger helmet backface deformation under ballistic impact increases. To characterize the potential for BABT, seven postmortem human head/neck specimens wearing a ballistic protective helmet were exposed to nonperforating impact, using a 9 mm, full metal jacket, 124 grain bullet with velocities of 400-460 m/s. An increasing trend of injury severity was observed, ranging from simple linear fractures to combinations of linear and depressed fractures. Overall, the ability to identify skull fractures resulting from BABT can be used in forensic investigations. Our results demonstrate a high risk of skull fracture due to BABT and necessitate the prevention of BABT as a design factor in future generations of protective gear. © 2014 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Backface deformation; Ballistic injury; Biomechanics; Forensic science; Head injury; Helmet deformation,"aged; ballistics; biomechanics; cadaver; contusion; equipment design; forensic pathology; gunshot injury; helmet; human; male; middle aged; pathology; radiography; skull fracture; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cadaver; Contusions; Equipment Design; Forensic Ballistics; Forensic Pathology; Head Protective Devices; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Skull Fracture, Depressed; Skull Fractures; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921284205,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

The aims of this study are to determine the wounding potential of air guns and to increase the consciousness about the dangers of the air guns. The kinetic energy limits are mentioned in 11 different countries legislations are evaluated with respect to test results. Twelve Kraton RTM G1 (15%) Transparent Ballistic Candle Blocks were prepared as the artificial soft-tissue test media in three different test models. A 4.5 mm air pistol and a 5.5 mm air rifle were used in the tests, which were performed in 1 and 10 m ranges. The mean penetration depth of the air pistol shots was 25.60 mm and the air rifle penetration was 79.14 mm from the 1 m range for three test models. In the 10 m range, the mean penetration depth of air pistol shots was 25.30 mm, while 79.19 mm was recorded for the air rifle. Considering these penetration depths, shots at especially the neck, eyes and thorax regions, can cause fatal injuries. For that reason, the kinetic energy limits should be the main point of air gun restrictions. © 2013 © 2013 Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Air guns; Weapon legislation; Wound ballistics,air; article; consciousness; experimental study; firearm; gunshot injury; hazard; law; legal aspect; neck,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890489979,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

The Act allows certain exceptions to be held without licence, most notably air weapons although these are limited by The Firearms (Dangerous Air Weapons) Rules 1969 and related regulations to below 12. ft lb (16.3. J) for air rifles and below 6. ft lb (8.1. J) for air pistols. Despite this there are occasional fatalities, typically 1 or 2 each year in the UK, from legally owned air weapons. In the USA there are over 20,000 visits each year to emergency departments due to injuries from air weapons and paintball guns. Despite this, limited research appears to have been carried out into the safety of air weapons and the present study tries to address this. Fresh samples of animal tissue were obtained from an abattoir or butcher and were embedded in ballistic gelatin. Pig heart, lung, liver and shoulder were used. By firing pellets into gelatin alone and into the combination of the gelatin and animal tissue it was possible to compare gelatin as a model for these tissues. The depth of penetration was similar but the residual track appeared to remain more open in the animal tissue. Pellets penetrated completely through the organ, with total penetration of gelatin and organ being typically around 10-15. cm. Samples of pig, cow and chicken skin were placed in contact with the gelatin or embedded in the gelatin to simulate the effect of skin on penetration into a body. Chicken skin had no effect, pig skin stopped the pellet and cow skin was perforated by the pellet. If cow skin was embedded in the gelatin there was little effect on the total amount of penetration, but cow skin on the front surface of the gelatin reduced penetration by about 30%.Computed tomography was used to examine the pellet track and to calculate the volume of damage produced. However, due to the similar densities of gelatin and organ a technique had to be developed to differentiate phases. A barium salt paste was applied to outer surfaces and iodine solution or barium nitrate solution containing red food colouring was injected into the pellet track to enhance the contrast of the track. The track through the gelatin tended to enclose itself whereas the track through the organ remained more open, presumably due to the inhomogeneity of the fibrous nature of the tissue.Pellets were also fired at construction materials (wood, plasterboard and brick) and computed tomography used to determine the volume of damage created. Pellets perforated single layers of wood and plasterboard and would embed in a second layer. However, if the two layers were in contact the pellet did not penetrate the first layer. An air rifle pellet could therefore perforate house construction materials, although the resultant kinetic energy would be low and further damage would be limited.Some of the possible physical parameters are discussed that might help predict the degree of damage caused, but from this study it is not possible to define a limit which could be proposed as safe. © 2012 Forensic Science Society.",Air weapon; Ballistic gel; Lethal; Safety; Terminal ballistics,"ballistic gelatin; gelatin; unclassified drug; air weapon; animal tissue; article; ballistics; computer assisted tomography; firearm; heart; liver; lung; nonhuman; shoulder; skin; Air weapon; Ballistic gel; Lethal; Safety; Terminal ballistics; Air; Animals; Chickens; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Humans; Kinetics; Safety; Swine; Weapons; Wounds, Penetrating",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881542270,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

The aim of the study was to assess the potential effect of shots caused by projectiles of various mass and structure fired from air guns with kinetic energy below 17 J on human soft tissues. As a model of soft tissue, we used 20% gelatin blocks.

In this study ballistic gel was tested by Bloom and rupture tests to check on consistency of production. Two series of tests were carried out firing into unclothed gel blocks and blocks loosely covered by different items of clothing to simulate attire (tee shirt, jeans, fleece, and jacket).The damage to the clothing caused by different shaped pellets when fired at different ranges was examined. The apparent hole size was affected by the shape of pellet (round, pointed, flat and hollow point) and whether damage was predominantly caused by pushing yarn to one side or by laceration of the yarn through cutting or tearing.The study also compared penetration into clothed gel and unclothed gel under identical conditions, and loose clothing greatly reduced penetration. With loose clothing at 9.1. m range clothing reduced penetration to 50-70% of the penetration of unclothed gel but at 18.3. m range only 7 out of 36 shots penetrated the gel. This cannot be accounted for by the energy loss at the longer range (3-7% reduction from 9.1. m to 18.3. m range in unclothed gels) and it is suggested that impulse may have a role to play.Shots that did not penetrate the gel were used to estimate the possible stopping time for the pellet (around 75. μs) and force (1700. N) or stress (100. MPa) required to bring the pellet to a halt.Even with these low energy projectiles, cloth fibres were entrained in the gel showing the potential for penetration of the body and subsequent infection. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Air rifle; Air weapon; Ballistic; Clothing; Gel; Pellet,"ballistic gel; gelatin; unclassified drug; air weapon pellet; Article; clothing; comparative study; controlled study; drive; fabric weave; gel transparency; parameters; pellet shape; penetration depth; pH; physical consistency; physical parameters; rupture strength; shooting range; simulation; weapon; air; ballistics; biological model; human; penetrating trauma; Air; Clothing; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Humans; Models, Biological; Weapons; Wounds, Penetrating",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918800519,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

While round balls or diabolo pellets have been the standard projectiles for airguns for decades, today, there are a large number of different airgun projectiles available. A very uncommon - and until now unique - discarding sabot airgun projectile (Sussex Sabo Bullet) was introduced into the market in the 1980s. The projectile, available in 0.177 (4.5 mm) and 0.22 (5.5 mm) caliber, consists of a plastic sabot cup surrounding a subcaliber copper-coated lead projectile in typical bullet shape. Following the typical principle of a discarding sabot projectile, the lightweight sabot is supposed to quickly loose velocity and to fall to the ground downrange while the bullet continues on target. These sabot-loaded projectiles are of special forensic interest due to their non-traceability and ballistic parameters. Therefore, it is the aim of this work to investigate the ballistic performance of these sabot airgun projectiles by high-speed video analyses and by measurement of the kinetic parameters of the projectile parts by a transient recording system as well as observing their physical features after being fired. While the sabot principle worked properly in high-energy airguns (E > 17 J), separation of the core projectile from the sabot cup was also observed when discharged in low-energy airguns (E < 7.5 J). While the velocity of the discarded Sussex Sabo core projectile was very close to the velocity of a diabolo-type reference projectile (RWS Meisterkugel), energy density was up to 60 % higher. To conclude, this work is the first study to demonstrate the regular function of this uncommon type of airgun projectile. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Airgun; Ballistics; Diabolo; Muzzle energy; Muzzle velocity; Sabot projectile,acceleration; article; ballistics; comparative study; equipment design; firearm; human; kinetics; legal aspect; videorecording; Acceleration; Equipment Design; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Humans; Kinetics; Video Recording,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896359019,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

The behavior of a bullet penetrating gelatin was quantified by the temporary cavity sizes in ballistic gelatin and the pressure values of bullet's impact. A numerical simulation model of a bullet penetrating the soft tissue simulant gelatin was built using the finite element method (FEM). The model was validated by the comparison between the numerical results and the experimental results. During a bullet penetrating ballistic gelatin, four stages were clearly observed in both the experiment and the numerical simulation: a smooth attenuation stage, a rolling stage, a full penetration stage, and a stage of expansion and contraction. The cavity evolution, equivalent stress field and the strain field in gelatin were analyzed by numerical simulation. Moreover, the effects of the bullet's impact velocities and angles of incidence on the temporary cavity in gelatin, its velocity attenuation, and its rolling angle were investigated, as well as the bullet's resistance and energy variation. The physical process and the interactive mechanism during a pistol bullet penetrating gelatin were comprehensively revealed.

Intermediate targets such as clothing can affect penetration into tissues. We studied the effect of common clothing fabrics as intermediate targets on penetration of shotgun shell pellets, using ordnance gelatin to simulate soft tissue and thin cowhide to simulate skin. A standard 12-gauge shotgun with modified choke was used with no. 8 shot ammunition. We found that protection afforded by fabrics to reduce penetration of shotgun pellets into tissues was greater at increasing distance from the muzzle beyond 40 yd (36.6 m). The thicker denim and cotton fabrics provided slightly greater protection than polyester.

Similar to conventional crossbows, life threatening injuries due to bolts discharged from pistol crossbows are reported in forensic and traumatological literature. While the ballistic background of conventional crossbows is comprehensively investigated, there are no investigations on the characteristic ballistic parameters (draw force, potential energy, recurve factor, kinetic energy, and efficiency) of pistol crossbows. Two hand-held pistol crossbows (Barnett Commando and Mini Cross Bow, rated draw force 362.9 N or 80 lbs) were tested. The maximum draw force was investigated using a dynamic tensile testing machine (TIRAtest 2705, TIRA GmbH). The potential energy was determined graphically by polynomial regression as area under the force-draw curve. External ballistic parameters of the bolts discharged from pistol crossbows were measured using a redundant ballistic speed measurement system (Dual-BMC 21a and Dual-LS 1000, Werner Mehl Kurzzeitmesstechnik). The average maximum draw force was 190.3 and 175.6 N for the Barnett and Mini Cross Bow, respectively. The corresponding total energy expended was 10.7 and 11 J, respectively. The recurve factor was calculated to be 0.705 and 1.044, respectively. Average bolt velocity was measured 43 up to 52 m/s. The efficiency was calculated up to 0.94. To conclude, this work provides the pending ballistic data on this special subgroup of crossbows which operate on a remarkable low kinetic energy level.

The yaw behavior of a bullet in soft tissue depends upon its design (length, ogive shape, ogive length, center of gravity, and pre-impact stability) as it penetrates soft tissue. The yaw characteristics of common spitzer-type military rifle bullets are relatively well known and quite reproducible when fired into suitable soft tissue simulants. This, in turn, results in a relationship between the amount of deformation of the bullet's shank and impact velocity with soft tissue. The specific relationship between impact velocity and bullet deformation must be worked out through empirical testing, but this relationship can be of critical importance in determining impact velocity, which, in turn, relates to range of fire. © 2015 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","""Magic"" bullet; Bullet deformation; Bullet shank; Cannelure; Full metal-jacketed bullets; Kennedy assassination; Lead core; Ogive; Range of fire; Retardation; Retarding force; Soft tissue penetration; Spitzer bullets; Wound ballistics; Yaw","ballistics; firearm; gunshot injury; human; procedures; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Humans; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922714847,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

In contact and close-range shots, the intensity of GSR deposition (soot, powder particles) is much greater than that in shots with smokeless powder ammunition. The same applies to any burning effects from the combustion gases. Besides, a wad of felt interposed between the propellant and the lead bullet may enter the wound channel. Apart from these findings seen in close-range shots, another characteristic feature results from the mostly spherical shape of the missiles causing maximum tissue damage at the entrance site. Two fatal injuries inflicted with muzzle-loading weapons are reported. In the first case, suicide was committed with a cal. 11.6 mm miniature cannon by firing a contact shot to the back of the neck. In test shots using black powder (1 and 2 g) as propellant, the mean bullet velocity measured 1 m away from the weapon was 87.11 and 146.85 m/s, respectively, corresponding to a kinetic energy of 32.49 and 92.95 J, respectively. Contact test shots to composite models consisting of ballistic soap covered by pig skin at the entrance site were evaluated by CT and revealed cone-like cavitations along the bullet path as known from spherical missiles and penetration depths up to 25 cm. The second case presented deals with a homicidal close-range shot discharged from a muzzle-loading percussion pistol cal.44. The skin around the entrance site (root of the nose) was densely covered with blackish soot and powder particles, whereas the eyebrows and eyelashes showed singeing of the hairs.

Most of them focus on the morphological features such as intense soot soiling, blast tattooing and burn effects in close-range shots or describe the wound ballistics of spherical lead bullets. Another kind of “unusual” and potentially lethal weapons are handguns destined for firing only blank cartridges such as starter and alarm pistols. The dangerousness of these guns is restricted to very close and contact range shots and results from the gas jet produced by the deflagration of the propellant. The present paper reports on a suicide committed with a muzzle-loading percussion pistol cal. 45. An unusually large stellate entrance wound was located in the precordial region, accompanied by an imprint mark from the ramrod and a faint greenish discoloration (apparently due to the formation of sulfhemoglobin). Autopsy revealed an oversized powder cavity, multiple fractures of the anterior thoracic wall as well as ruptures of the heart, the aorta, the left hepatic lobe and the diaphragm. In total, the zone of mechanical destruction had a diameter of approx. 15 cm. As there was no exit wound and no bullet lodged in the body, the injury was caused exclusively by the inrushing combustion gases of the propellant (black powder) comparable with the gas jet of a blank cartridge gun. In contact shots to ballistic gelatine using the suicide’s pistol loaded with black powder but no projectile, the formation of a nearly spherical cavity could be demonstrated by means of a high-speed camera. The extent of the temporary cavity after firing with 5 g of black powder roughly corresponded to the zone of destruction found in the suicide’s body. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Black powder; Contact shot; Gas jet; Muzzle-loading pistol; Suicide,"gas; gelatin; powder; ballistics; biological model; case report; diaphragm; firearm; gas; gunshot injury; heart rupture; human; injuries; liver; middle aged; pathology; powder; suicide; thorax injury; Diaphragm; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Gases; Gelatin; Heart Rupture; Humans; Liver; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Powders; Suicide; Thoracic Injuries; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939881864,,IFSMS 2016,Firearms,Firearms

At the post-mortem examination the calvarium exhibited an atypical injury that showed both entrance and exit wound characteristics, compatible with a keyhole defect of the skull. Keyhole fractures occur when a projectile strikes the cranium tangentially, owing to the vertical and horizontal forces usually generated by the fragmentation of the bullet. Atypically, in our case the bullet showed no fragmentation after the impact with the cranial bones and was still able to result in a keyhole defect.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators. © 2009 by the National Academy of Sciences.

These individual marks are reproducible between shots; however, over a large number of consecutive shots, it has been observed that minute changes in these individual marks may occur. Changes in individual marks may affect an examiner in their ability to identify or eliminate and may change the magnitude of a likelihood ratio, depending on the system used by the laboratory, but the effect that these changes have on the Integrated Ballistic Identification System (IBIS®) is largely unknown. If such changes negatively affect the performance of the IBIS® then consequences may result with respect to the correct matching candidate not be returned in the top results further compared by an examiner. Two hundred consecutive test fires performed in a clean environment (indoor shooting range) were collected in sequence from 24 new Ruger® SR9 9 mm pistols and entered into an IBIS® Heritage™ System. The full known match data were extracted for each firearm, and δ sets were created that had a specific number of cartridge cases between the two cartridge cases being compared. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) values for these δ sets were compared to the full known match sets to determine if any significant changes in performance resulted. Although there were instances of significant differences, these only occurred in less than 25% of comparisons, and overall no decreasing trends in performance were observed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Breech face; Consecutively fired cartridge cases; Firing pin; IBIS®,"area under the curve; Article; ballistics; breech face; bullet; comparative study; firearm; firing pin; performance; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; trend study; factual database; human; Databases, Factual; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Humans",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021732540,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

Each pistol fired 3070 consecutive shots. The first 20 cartridge cases were all introduced into the system. From the 21st until the 3070th shot, every ten cartridge cases were collected and one random sample of each group was introduced as the 30th, 40th, … 3070th round. Thus, we introduced 325 specimens for each pistol and established a database of 1625 specimens. We used the first and every 100th specimen of each firearm to start correlations in the database and analyzed the results, especially the results of specimen 0001, 1000, 2000, 3000. Consequently, specimens fired closer in sequence to the specimen under examination had higher similarity scores. In boxplots, the boxes of known match specimens were much higher than boxes of known non match specimens. The Evofinder® ranked nearly all known match specimens in the first position of either firing pin impression list or breech face mark list. In conclusion, the two marks changed over 3070 consecutive shots and cartridge cases of nearer shot numbers were more similar.

In the automatic correlation process, the first cartridge of each firearm is separately performed correlation against the database. It is found that the similarity score for match objects changes slightly as the shot number increases, indicating slight variations of marks. However, these variations have not prohibited the Evofinder® system to make correct correlation and rank 100% of the known match objects on the top of the correlation list by either firing pin impression or breech face mark.

Using optical comparison microscopy, two separate experiments were carried out to test this hypothesis. A subsample of 617 test-fired cases were subjected to algorithmic comparison by the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS). The second experiment subjected the full set of 1632 cases to manual comparisons using traditional pattern matching. None of the cartridge cases were ""matched"" by either of these two experiments.

Thus, producing reference bullets with a questioned firearm is an essential step. Different kinds of system have been developed to safely recover bullets fired from questioned firearms. However, the performance of each system and its impact on traces left on the bullets have not been addressed. Three bullet recovery systems – a horizontal water tank, a cotton tube and a recently designed fleece – were used to fire seven types of ammunition of various type, shape and casing. The bullets were then described and images of their surface were acquired with an automatic system to study the impact of each system on the bullets. The water tank is the more efficient system in terms of quality of the marks. However, it cannot be used to fire every type of ammunition. Some of them, such those used by law enforcement, tend to be damaged with this system. A way to mitigate the problem is to use the cotton or the fleece-based systems, the latter being more universal. It requires a cleaning step to remove all the fibres from the surface of the bullet, but the marks left by the weapon are still of interest. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cotton tube; Firearms identification; Fleece layers; Water tank,Article; bullet; cleaning; comparative study; controlled study; equipment design; priority journal; three bullet recovery system,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051126582,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

Here we investigate the factors that influence the ability to make toolmark identifications on ammunition discharged from pistols recovered from such car fires. This work was carried out by conducting a number of controlled furnace tests in conjunction with real car fire tests in which three 9 mm semi-automatic pistols were burned. Comparisons between pre-burn and post burn test fired ammunition discharged from these pistols were then performed to establish if identifications were still possible. The surfaces of the furnace heated samples and car fire samples were examined following heating/burning to establish what factors had influenced their surface morphology. The primary influence on the surfaces of the furnace heated and car fire samples was the formation of oxide layers. The car fire samples were altered to a greater extent than the furnace heated samples. Identifications were still possible between pre- and post-burn discharged cartridge cases, but this was not the case for the discharged bullets. It is suggested that the reason for this is a difference between the types of firearms discharge-generated toolmarks impressed onto the base of cartridge cases compared to those striated along the surfaces of bullets. It was also found that the temperatures recorded in the front foot wells were considerably less than those recorded on top of the rear seats during the car fires. These factors should be assessed by forensic firearms examiners when performing casework involving pistols recovered from car fires.",Ballistic forensics; toolmark identification; firearms identification; car fires; thermal oxidation; metallography,,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

The lead bullets of this ammunition are encapsulated in a red, proprietary polymer coating, termed “Total Synthetic Jacket (TSJ),” designed to prevent metal-on-metal contact in the bore of the firearm. The purported benefits of this polymer jacket include a cleaner barrel with minimal fouling, reduced friction for cooler shooting, and reduced lead exposure. This ammunition may be problematic for the forensic scientist, particularly in relation to gunshot residue examinations and firearms identification. Other plastic-coated bullets, such as Nyclad bullets (Syntech predecessor), have made identification to an individual firearm difficult due to the poor rifling engraving on the polymer jacket and the occasional stripping of the polymer jacket material. This study evaluates the effects of Syntech ammunition on the various aspects of forensic firearm identification, particularly the identification of synthetically-coated bullets to an individual firearm, potential trace evidence recovered from the bore of barrels firing this ammunition, and gunshot residue examinations. Deformation and poor rifling engagement on the synthetic material made microscopic comparisons difficult, especially when comparing two Syntech bullets to each other, and often resulted in little more than the observation of class characteristics. During the examination of this ammunition, several unique features were observed, such as, various types of pitting and other deformations exhibited on the synthetic jacket material, the presence of bismuth in gunshot primer residue examination that may lead to the association of this primer, and the deposition of jacketing material as both flakes and bullet wipe on cotton witness panels. © 2018, Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners.","9mm luger; American eagle; Bismuth; Bullet; Catalyst; Coat; Comparison; Fouling; Gunshot residue (GSR); Jacket; Lead styphnate; Lipstick round; Nyclad; Primer; Sodium rhodizonate; Syntech; Synthetic; Tetracene; Total synthetic jacket (TSJ,) trace",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067985976,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

The cartridge boxes also advertise reduced friction, the elimination of lead and copper fouling, extended barrel life and improved accuracy. Initial testing utilized samples in 9mm Luger and .40 S&W which were discharged in conventionally rifled and polygonally rifled pistols, and the fired bullets recovered from water and ballistic soap. The polymer jackets survived these internal and terminal ballistic events with minimal damage and loss. Subsequent testing was carried out on the .45 Automatic version of this novel ammunition once it became available. The barrel markings on the bearing surfaces of these bullets were limited to the general rifling characteristics. No striae suitable for firearms identification were observed on the test-fired specimens collected in this study, nor were any visible residues of the bright red polymer coating observed in the bores of the test firearms.

The first clue that one is dealing with something well outside the norm is the weight of a recovered projectile followed by its exceptionally shiny appearance. These bullets typically acquire the general rifling characteristics of the firearm from which they are discharged, but not necessarily reproducible striae patterns sufficient for firearms identification. Although the shape and dimensions of these bullets are virtually identical to their lead counterpart, tin’s substantially lower density compared to that of lead, results in their greatly-reduced weight of 26 grains.

The typical firing pin of a bolt action rifle is spring loaded, and because of its potential movement in the bolt housing, its impact position on the primer of a cartridge case may change, however, its shape and individual characteristics will still allow for identification.

In this study, cartridges in six popular calibers,.380 Auto, 9mm Luger,.357 Magnum,.40 S&W,.45 Auto and.223 Rem, were handloaded with incrementally increasing propellant charges to ultimately produce calculated peak pressures typically in excess of 80,000 psi (550000 kPa) as determined by the QuickLoad™ program. The actual peak pressures were measured with test barrels equipped with piezo transducers and an Oehler M83™ pressure-velocity system. This allowed a comparison between the QuickLoad™ calculations and the measured values as well as an assessment of the accuracy of the QuickLoad™ program in predicting muzzle velocity and peak pressure values. The central purpose, however, was to study and photograph the breechface markings in the fired primers and to measure the firing pin impression depths for each powder loading level when these specially loaded cartridges were fired in actual firearms.

These measurements were done on pristine and artificially damaged samples. The goal was to determine a standardized approach when entering bullet measurements in a rifling database, such as the FBI General Rifling Characteristics (GRC) database. It was determined that separating fired bullets into two categories, complete and partial/incomplete, and applying a standardized variance (±) to the range of land and groove impression widths from a bullet was the best method to use. For instances where all the land and groove impressions are available for measurement, a ± 0.003ʺ variance is suitable. As the number of measurable land and groove impressions decrease, one must increase the queried range variance to as high as ± 0.015ʺ. This approach was tested to determine how these values would affect probable manufacturer lists from the GRC. It was found that utilizing the ranges established from this procedure generated a list with a good balance between the length of the list and potential misses. © 2018, Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners.

The reason is because subclass characteristics have an appearance similar to individual characteristics but, unlike individual characteristics, can be present on a number of tools created in close proximity with one another. Therefore, if not properly assessed, a tool mark on a questioned piece of evidence could be mistakenly linked back to a tool other than the one that made it based on the correspondence of subclass characteristics. Notably, within the last 25 years there have been some excellent research studies in this area that have helped recognize specific machining methods that have a propensity to leave subclass characteristics as well as providing guidance on how to assess tools and tool marks for subclass influences.

Critics have attacked the scientific basis for the assumptions and claims made by forensic scientists both in and out of the courtroom. Defenders have emphasized courts' longstanding acceptance of forensic science evidence, the relative dearth of known errors, and practitioners' skill and experience. This Article reflects an effort made by a averse group of participants in these debates, including law professors, academics from several disciplines, and practicing forensic scientists, to find and explore common ground. To what extent do the forensic sciences need to change in order to place themselves on an appropriately secure foundation in the twentyfirst century? We all firmly agree that the traditional forensic sciences in general, and the pattern identification disciplines, sua as fingerprint, firearm, toobnark, and handwriting identification evidence in particukr, do not cunently possess-and absolutely must develop-a well-established scientific foundation. This can only be accomplished through the development of a research culture that permeates the entire field of forensic science. A research culture, we argue, must be grounded in the values of empiricism, transparency, and a commitment to an ongoing critical perspective. The forensic science disciplines need to substantially increase their commitment to evidence from empirical research as the basis for their conclusions. Sound research, rather than experience, training, and longstanding use, must become the central method by which assertions are justified. In this Article, we describe the underdeveloped research culture in the non-DNA forensic sciences, offer suggestions for how it might be improved, and explain why it matters.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955046353,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

The CMC method is based on the principle of discretization. The toolmark image of the reference sample is divided into correlation cells. Each cell is registered to the cell-sized area of the compared image that has maximum surface topography similarity. For each resulting cell pair, one parameter quantifies the similarity of the cell surface topography and three parameters quantify the pattern congruency of the registration position and orientation. An identification (declared match) requires a significant number of CMCs, that is, cell pairs that meet both similarity and pattern congruency requirements. The use of cell correlations reduces the effects of “invalid regions” in the compared image pairs and increases the correlation accuracy. The identification accuracy of the CMC method can be further improved by considering a feature named “convergence,” that is, the tendency of the x–y registration positions of the correlated cell pairs to converge at the correct registration angle when comparing same-source samples at different relative orientations. In this paper, the difference of the convergence feature between known matching (KM) and known non-matching (KNM) image pairs is characterized, based on which an improved algorithm is developed for breech face image correlations using the CMC method. Its advantage is demonstrated by comparison with three existing CMC algorithms using four datasets. The datasets address three different brands of consecutively manufactured pistol slides, with significant differences in the distribution overlap of cell pair topography similarity for KM and KNM image pairs. For the same CMC threshold values, the convergence algorithm demonstrates noticeably improved results by reducing the number of false-positive or false-negative CMCs in a comparison. © 2017",Ballistics; Congruent Matching Cells (CMC); Convergence; Firearm evidence identification; Forensics,"algorithm; Article; congruent matching cell method; convergence algorithm; firearm; forensic identification; image processing; intermethod comparison; investigative procedures; matching image pair; measurement accuracy; non matching image pair; priority journal; quality control; validation process; ballistics; firearm; human; image processing; procedures; surface property; Algorithms; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Surface Properties",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032189395,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

However, compared with breach face impressions, there is only a limited surface area over which firing pin impressions can be compared. Furthermore, the curvature of firing pin impressions makes it difficult to perform automatic correlations of the surfaces. In this study, a new method and related algorithm named congruent matching cross-sections (CMX) are proposed. Each firing pin impression is sliced into layers and the resulting circular cross-sections are converted to two dimensional linear profiles by a polar coordinate transformation. The differential profile extraction method is used for extracting the high frequency micro-features, or the individual characteristics, for accurate correlation. Three parameters are proposed for determining whether these pairwise firing pin impressions are fired from the same firearm. The cross-correlation function (CCF) is used for quantifying similarity of the pairwise profiles which represent the two correlated firing pin images. If the correlated cartridge pair is fired from the same firearm, the maximum CCF value between each of the profile pairs from the reference and the correlated firing pin impressions will be high. The other two parameters relate to the horizontal (or angular) and vertical range of relative shifts that the profiles undergo to obtain the maximum CCF. These shifts are the phase angle θ which corresponds to a horizontal shift of the 2D profiles and the vertical shift distance of slice section, i.e. where the profiles match in the depth of the impression. These shift parameters are used to determine the congruency of the pairwise profile patterns. When these parameter values and their statistical distributions are collected for analysis, the CMX number is derived as a key parameter for a conclusive identification or exclusion. Validation tests using 40 cartridge cases of three different brands fired from 10 firearms produced by three different manufacturers yielded clear separation between known matching (KM) and known non-matching (KNM) image pairs, which strongly supports the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed CMX method. © 2016.",CMX; Congruent matching cross-sections; Cross-correlation function; Firearm identification; Firing pin impression; Forensic science,algorithm; analytic method; analytical parameters; Article; ballistics; congruent matching cross section; correlation analysis; correlation function; cross correlation function; dimensional measurement accuracy; feasibility study; firearm; firing pin impression; linear system; priority journal; statistical distribution; validation study,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964458885,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

While strong scrutiny is a healthy and necessary part of any scientific endeavor, much of the current criticism leveled at firearm and toolmark analysis is, at best, misinformed and, at worst, punditry. One of the most persistent criticisms stems from the view that as the field lacks quantified random match probability data (or at least a firm statistical model) with which to calculate the probability of a false match, all expert testimony concerning firearm and toolmark identification or source attribution is unreliable and should be ruled inadmissible. However, this critique does not stem from the hard work of actually obtaining data and performing the scientific research required to support or reject current findings in the literature. Although there are sound reasons (described herein) why there is currently no unifying probabilistic model for the comparison of striated and impressed toolmarks as there is in the field of forensic DNA profiling, much statistical research has been, and continues to be, done to aid the criminal justice system. This research has thus far shown that error rate estimates for the field are very low, especially when compared to other forms of judicial error. The first purpose of this paper is to point out the logical fallacies in the arguments of a small group of pundits, who advocate a particular viewpoint but cloak it as fact and research. The second purpose is to give a balanced review of the literature regarding random match probability models and statistical applications that have been carried out in forensic firearm and toolmark analysis. © 2017 American Academy of Forensic Sciences",coincidental match probability; correspondence probabilities; Daubert; empirical error rate; error rate; false match error; firearm and toolmark identification; forensic science; likelihood ratio; likelihood ratio; probability; random match probabilities; random match probability; research; statistics; uncertainty,article; criminal justice; DNA fingerprinting; firearm; forensic science; human; probability; sound; uncertainty; writing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018281140,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

This paper describes the recently developed congruent matching cells (CMC) method for image comparisons, its application to firearm evidence identification, and its usage and initial tests for error rate estimation. The CMC method divides compared topography images into correlation cells. Four identification parameters are defined for quantifying both the topography similarity of the correlated cell pairs and the pattern congruency of the registered cell locations. A declared match requires a significant number of CMCs, i.e., cell pairs that meet all similarity and congruency requirements. Initial testing on breech face impressions of a set of 40 cartridge cases fired with consecutively manufactured pistol slides showed wide separation between the distributions of CMC numbers observed for known matching and known non-matching image pairs. Another test on 95 cartridge cases from a different set of slides manufactured by the same process also yielded widely separated distributions. The test results were used to develop two statistical models for the probability mass function of CMC correlation scores. The models were applied to develop a framework for estimating cumulative false positive and false negative error rates and individual error rates of declared matches and non-matches for this population of breech face impressions. The prospect for applying the models to large populations and realistic case work is also discussed. The CMC method can provide a statistical foundation for estimating error rates in firearm evidence identifications, thus emulating methods used for forensic identification of DNA evidence. © 2017",Ballistics identification; CMC; Congruent matching cell; Error rate; Firearm; Forensics,analytical error; Article; ballistics; correlation analysis; false negative result; false positive result; firearm; forensic science; image analysis; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; priority journal; probability; quantitative analysis; statistical analysis; statistical model; topography; article; ballistics; forensic identification; intermethod comparison,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040220868,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

A 2016 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report questioned the scientific validity of such analysis (President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, Washington, DC, Executive Office of the President). One recommendation was to convert firearms analysis to an objective method. We propose a fully automated, open-source method for comparing breechface marks on cartridge cases using 2D optical images. We improve on existing methodology by automating the selection of marks, and removing the effects of circular symmetry. We propose an empirical computation of a “random match probability” given a known database, which can be used to quantify the weight of evidence.

The similarities between cartridge case specimens fired by thirteen S&W.40S&W Sigma pistols are quantified, and their respective LRs are computed. The results show that the influence of subclass characteristics on the LRs is limited, even when these features are prevalent among the potential sources considered in a case.

No published research to support the number of test fires needed to represent the variability present within the impressions left on a cartridge case could be found. When a suspect firearm is submitted to a firearm examiner, typically two to four test fires are performed. The recovered cartridge cases are compared to each other to determine which characteristics from the firearm are reproducing, and then compared to any cartridge cases collected at a crime scene. The aim of this research was to determine the number of test fires examiners should perform when a suspect firearm is submitted to the lab to balance cartridge case acquisition time with performance accuracy. Each firearm in the IBIS® database at West Virginia University® is represented by approximately 100 fired cartridge case entries. Random samples of cartridge cases were taken separately from the breech face match score and firing pin match score lists.

A number of researchers are trying to improve bullet-identification systems to address deficiencies detailed within the National Academy of Science report (2009). More recently focus has turned to making use of more sophisticated imaging modalities to view entire regions of the projectile and the development of automated systems for the comparison of the topographical surfaces recorded. Projectiles from a newly bought air pistol with 0.177 calibre pellets (unjacketed), fired series of 609 pellets were examined using an optical microscope. A mathematical methodology was developed to pre-process the resultant topographical maps generating point data for comparison, analysed using the principal component analysis (PCA). In most cases limited to reasonable success was achieved. The objective method still requires an operator to identify the Land Engraved Areas to be scanned, however the mathematical alignments were objectively achieved. The PCA results illustrated that the striation marks were neither exclusive nor specific to the LEA regions but rather crossed over regions. This study also proves that a single weapon does not necessarily leave identical marks of projectiles on its surface. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Acquired characteristics; Air weapon and pellets; Bullet-identification system; Principal component analysis; Surface topography measurements; Unjacketed bullets,Article; ballistics; computer program; firearm; image processing; mathematical model; measurement error; microscopy; principal component analysis; priority journal; reproducibility; surface property,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962808963,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

Each barrel leaves individual striation patterns on bullets. Hence, the striation information of bullets is helpful for firearm identification. Common automatic identification methods process these images using linear time invariant (LTI) filters based on correlation. These methods do not consider the sensitivity of correlation based comparisons to nonlinear baseline drifts. The striations are undeniably random unique micro structures caused by random non-model-based imperfections in the tools used in rifling process, therefore any characteristic profile that is extracted from a bullet image is statistically non-stationary. Due to limitations of LTI filters, using them in smoothing bullet images and profiles may cause information loss and impact the process of identification. To address these problems, in this article, we consider bullet images as nonlinear non-stationary processes and propose a novel method which uses ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) as a preprocessing algorithm for smoothing and feature extraction. The features extracted by EEMD algorithm not only contain less noise, but also have no nonlinear baseline drifts. These improvements help the correlation based comparison methods to perform more robustly and efficiently. The experiments showed that our proposed method attained better results compared with two common methods in the field of automatic bullet identification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Automatic bullet identification; Cross correlation; Ensemble Empirical mode decomposition,algorithm; amplitude modulation; Article; bullet; controlled study; correlation function; correlational study; empirical mode decomposition; ensemble empirical mode decomposition; extraction; filter; forensic identification; image analysis; image processing; image reconstruction; linear time invariant filter; noise reduction; nonlinear system; oscillation; priority journal; sensitivity analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029294340,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

(FTI), to compare the results of a 3D IBIS® analysis to those of a 2D IBIS® analysis (both the 2D and 3D capabilities of the Trax™ were utilized). The test-fired cartridge cases from a sample set of twelve 9 mm Luger firearms were used to study 2D and 3D correlations; the intra- and inter-variation of the results from both systems were also analyzed. These twelve firearms were selected as a representation of the firearms in the WVU collection. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrates the discriminating power of the method by determining how well it can differentiate between known match and known non-match cartridge cases. The least discriminating feature when using the Heritage™ System (only 2D) was the breech face while the highest discriminating feature was the firing pin. The least discriminating feature of the Trax™ System was the breech face (2D) whereas the best discriminating feature was the firing pin (2D). Although a firearm examiner may generally find the breech face to contain more information for comparison, the IBIS attributed higher scores to the firing pin impressions. Over 60% of the firearms displayed a significant increase in the area under the curve (AUC) values for the Trax™ 3D breech face scores over the Heritage™ breech face scores, indicating better performance in that aspect with this set of firearms. Furthermore, use of the side-light feature for analyzing breech face marks using the Trax™ System resulted in better discrimination versus the non-side-lit breech face scores; 75% of the cartridge cases showed a significant increase in the AUC values with the side-light feature of the Trax™ System compared with the Heritage™ System. The Trax™ System did not show the same increase in performance with 3D firing pin scores, as the Heritage™ System had a higher average AUC based on firing pin scores. © 2018, Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners.

Eight room temperature and heated reagents were applied to titanium samples. Only one of the eight reagents had a visible reaction with the metal and was further tested. Using eleven titanium samples containing markings with four different methods of application, concentrated hydrochloric acid was applied to the heated titanium samples and allowed to remain on the metal for variable lengths of time. Markings on ten of the eleven samples were fully or partially restored. Based on these results, this novel approach to serial number restoration on titanium firearms has clear potential for widespread use in serial number restoration. © 2016, Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners.

Information about the listings (i.e. sales proposals) and vendors’ profiles were extracted to draw an overview of the actual online trafficking of weapons. Relationships between vendors were also inferred through the analysis of online digital traces and content similarities. Weapons trafficking is mainly concentrated on two major cryptomarkets. Besides, it accounts for a very small proportion of the illicit trafficking on cryptomarkets compared to the illicit drugs trafficking. Among all weapon related listings (n = 386), firearms only account for approximately 25% of sales proposal since the proportion of non-lethal and melee weapons is important (around 46%). Based on the recorded pseudonyms, a total of 96 vendor profiles were highlighted. Some pseudonyms were encountered on several cryptomarkets, suggesting that some vendors may manage accounts on different markets. This hypothesis was strengthened by comparing pseudonyms to online traces such as PGP keys, images and profiles descriptions. Such a method allowed to estimate more accurately the number of vendors offering weapons across cryptomarkets.

The likelihood ratio provides a level of support for the evidence, given two competing hypotheses. This paper considers the feasibility of a likelihood ratio approach for the forensic firearms and toolmarks discipline within Australian police forensic laboratories. An experienced practitioner in forensic firearms and toolmarks examination, the author embarked on a study tour to a number of European forensic laboratories, undertaken with the support of the Australian and New Zealand Forensic Science Society (ANZFSS) 2013 Allan Hodda Memorial Travel Award to examine this issue. This study tour, along with research of the literature, highlighted advantages and disadvantages in using evaluative reporting. This paper discusses the practical benefits and challenges of future implementation of this framework for the firearms and toolmarks discipline within Australia. The issues discussed are also likely to be relevant to forensic laboratories in other parts of the world where firearms/toolmarks are examined and in other forensic comparative sciences such as fingerprints, shoeprints and document examination, should evaluative reporting be considered for adoption. © 2017, Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners.

While there are standardized and generally accepted procedures for testing the performance of air guns, the method of seating the diabolo pellets deeper into the breech of break barrel spring-piston air guns has not found its way into standardized test procedures. The influence of pellet seating on the external ballistic parameters was investigated using ten different break barrel spring-piston air guns. Test shots were performed with the diabolo pellets seated 2 mm deeper into the breech using a pellet seater. The results were then compared to reference shots with conventionally loaded diabolo pellets. Projectile velocity was measured with a high-precision redundant ballistic speed measurement system. In eight out of ten weapons, the muzzle energy increased significantly when the pellet seater was used. The average increase in kinetic energy was 31 % (range 9–96 %). To conclude, seating the pellet even slightly deeper into the breech of spring-piston air guns might significantly alter the muzzle energy. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that this effect is taken into account when accurate and reliable measurements of air gun muzzle velocity are necessary. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Airgun; Ballistics; Diabolo; Muzzle energy; Muzzle velocity; Pellet,air; ballistics; firearm; human; kinetics; Air; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Humans; Kinetics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979233621,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

The accuracy and precision of the estimated trajectories will vary depending on variables such as, the applied method of reconstruction, the (true) angle of incidence, the properties of the target material and the properties of the bullet upon impact. This study focused on the accuracy and precision of estimated bullet trajectories when different variants of the probing method, ellipse method, and lead-in method are applied on bullet defects resulting from shots at various angles of incidence on drywall, MDF and sheet metal. The results show that in most situations the best performance (accuracy and precision) is seen when the probing method is applied. Only for the lowest angles of incidence the performance was better when either the ellipse or lead-in method was applied.

The inherent error range of 0.02°–2.10° was noted while the overall error for laser scanning ranged between 0.04° and 1.98°. The inter- and intraobserver errors for trajectory rod placement and virtual trajectory marking showed that the range of variation for rod placement was between 0.1°–1° in drywall and 0.05°–0.5° in plywood. Virtual trajectory marking accuracy tests showed that 75% of data values were below 0.91° and 0.61° on azimuth and vertical angles, respectively.

The first study focused on the critical ricochet angle, at which 50% of a given bullet type will ricochet from a given wood type. The results show that the critical ricochet angle increases with increasing hardness and density of wood. The results of the second study confirm that a bullet’s ricochet angle from wood (a yielding surface) usually exceeds the angle of incidence and has a tendency to deflect to the left or right, depending on its rotation. The left or right deflection can be increased or counteracted by the direction of the grain of the wood. In this study, the deflection was strongest when the angle of the wood grain, in relation to the bullet’s plane of impact, lay between 30° and 75° and the angle of incidence came close to the critical ricochet angle. The magnitude of the effect also depended on the type of wood. Ricochet marks from heavily deflected bullets often showed a curved appearance. The curvature was less defined for bullets that produced a ‘tunnel’ shaped ricochet defect with a separate entrance and exit hole.","ricochet, critical angle, deflection, wood, timber, lumber, wood grain, growth rings, Janka hardness",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077295994,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

This phenomenon has been termed ‘backspatter’ and if backspattered biological material reaches the firearm on its backward trajectory it may persist on and be recovered from the firearm's inside surfaces. Molecular genetic analysis of backspatter generated by contact shots and shots from very short distances has already been demonstrated to critically contribute to victim identification and the reconstruction of firearm-related crimes. It is not known, however, up to what shooting distance can backspatter be found on firearms’ inside surfaces and what influence the weapon's type and caliber has on backspatter attributes (e.g. reach, amount and distribution). Therefore, the present pilot study investigated the effect of serval combinations of shooting distances and types of firearms and ammunitions on the analyzability of co-extracted DNA and micro-RNA in samples of backspatter collected from interior and exterior surfaces of the firearms after experimental shootings employing standardized ballistic models. We demonstrate the limiting effect of shooting distance and the type of firearm on the yield of nucleic acids recovered from backspatter and the success rates of forensic DNA profiling and RNA based body-fluid and organ tissue identification in experimental shootings. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Backspatter; Forensic DNA analysis; Forensic miRNA analysis; Molecular ballistics; Shooting distance,"DNA; microRNA; DNA; gelatin; microsatellite DNA; RNA; Article; ballistics; DNA determination; DNA extraction; DNA fingerprinting; female; firearm; forensic identification; human; human tissue; male; pilot study; priority journal; RNA analysis; RNA extraction; RNA fingerprinting; surface property; weapon; ballistics; biological model; blood analysis; brain chemistry; firearm; isolation and purification; Blood Chemical Analysis; Brain Chemistry; DNA; DNA Fingerprinting; Female; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Humans; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Biological; Pilot Projects; RNA",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85000470569,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

Such calculations require the use of a suitable exterior ballistics program and a suitable ballistic coefficient (BC) for the bullet associated with the particular incident. BCs for most of the common commercial bullets available in the U.S. can be found in the various versions of Sierra Bullets’ exterior ballistics programs. This is not the situation for the numerous variants of the Russian M43 bullet loaded in 7.62×39mm ammunition, nearly all of which are of foreign manufacture. Yet given the popularity and ready availability of a large variety and sources of 7.62×39mm ammunition, one can reasonably expect bullets of this type will be involved in future long distance shooting incidents. The effective G1 and G7 ballistic coefficients of a collection of military M43 bullets from a number of countries as well as several commercial variants of the original design have been determined through the use of Doppler radar and Sierra Bullets’ Infinity-7 exterior ballistics program. © 2017, Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners.

However, they are difficult to photograph because of the transparent nature of glass. Standard glass documentation photographs prohibit determination of the deflection direction of light rays off fracture features, thus creating difficulty in determining the cone-bearing surface of the Hertzian fracture. This article presents a new method for photographing these fractures on various glass materials. Surface reflection photography (SRP) documents the contour-dependent nature of the surface and fracture, allowing the shooting reconstructionist to determine the bevel-bearing surface of the glass from the collected images without direct observation of the glass material.

In a two-part study, several experiments were conducted to examine the properties, performance, and forensic implications of Hi-Tek bullet coating. In part II, the coating was examined for its potential to leave trace evidence of value in barrels and on targets. Although some coating was removed in the barrel, additional coating did not appear to be removed when perforating target materials. Trace evidence was not commonly seen on test panels. Instruments analyzed the chemical properties of Hi-Tek coating, and sodium rhodizonate was used to test coating performance in light of marketing claims. In part I of this study, Hi-Tek coated bullets were microscopically examined and compared to jacketed bullets, lead bullets, and other Hi-Tek coated bullets.

After a review of the medical records, radiology, the victim's clothing, and performance of an experiment using the gun and ammunition, it was established that the entrance wound was located on the abdomen, and the exit wound was located on the buttock. The initial problems with recognizing the entrance and exit wounds encountered by the surgical team were caused by bullet deformation. Before hitting the body, the projectile pierced a mobile phone that was in the pocket of the woman's jacket, subsequently causing a large atypical secondary entrance wound. The experiment confirmed that, when the projectile passed through an obstacle with consequent deformation, it caused more extensive gunshot wounds, both at the entrance and at the exit, as well as more severe damage to the bones. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Key messages are that test variables, projectile type (bullet, fragmentation), impact site on the body and intermediate layers (e.g. clothing, personal protective equipment (PPE)) can affect the resulting wound profiles. © 2018, The Author(s).",Bullets; Gelatine; Lethality and survivability; Temporary and permanent cavities,"gelatin; animal; animal model; ballistics; biological model; bone; firearm; gunshot injury; human; injuries; research; Animals; Bone and Bones; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Humans; Models, Animal; Models, Biological; Research; Wounds, Gunshot",Review,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046414181,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

Many simulants have been used, with gelatine amongst the most common. While two concentrations of gelatine (10 and 20 %) have been used extensively, no agreed standard exists for the preparation of either. Comparison of ballistic damage produced in both concentrations is lacking. The damage produced in gelatine is also questioned, with regards to what it would mean for specific areas of living tissue. The aim of the work discussed in this paper was to consider how damage caused by selected pistol and rifle ammunition varied in different simulants. Damage to gelatine blocks 10 and 20 % in concentration were tested with 9 mm Luger (9 × 19 full metal jacket; FMJ) rounds, while damage produced by.223 Remington (5.56 × 45 Federal Premium® Tactical® Bonded®) rounds to porcine thorax sections (skin, underlying tissue, ribs, lungs, ribs, underlying tissue, skin; backed by a block of 10 % gelatine) were compared to 10 and 20 % gelatine blocks. Results from the.223 Remington rifle round, which is one that typically expands on impact, revealed depths of penetration in the thorax arrangement were significantly different to 20 % gelatine, but not 10 % gelatine. The level of damage produced in the simulated thoraxes was smaller in scale to that witnessed in both gelatine concentrations, though greater debris was produced in the thoraxes. © 2016, The Author(s).",10 and 20 % gelatine; Pistol; Rifle; Tissue simulants,"gelatin; animal; ballistics; biological model; comparative study; gunshot injury; pathology; pig; procedures; thorax injury; Animals; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Models, Biological; Swine; Thoracic Injuries; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957600717,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

Research into the effects different ammunition has on the human body has been conducted using tissue simulants such as Ballistics Ordnance Gelatine. Previous research has found that with low velocity projectiles, the tissue simulants only represent a selected few organs, as the human body and its organs/tissues are not homogeneous. The aim of this research was to determine which ballistic simulants best represent the abdomen and thorax, for the purposes of anatomical modelling. A mounted firearm was used to fire specially made ammunition containing a sabot and steel spherical projectile at medium (∼500 m/s) and high (∼900 m/s) velocities. Test specimens of 50 mm cube porcine tissues (lung, liver, kidney and heart) and ballistics simulants (20% and 10% Ballistics Gelatine and Clear Gel) were shot at and the energy loss determined using Doppler radar, optical infra-red sighting screens and high speed video. This study determined that the conclusions drawn from studies in these tissue simulants may not be an accurate representation of what occurs in human tissues and that different impact velocities produce differing results. New simulants are required to better represent the energy loss of a projectile through the organs of the abdomen and thorax and the results of this study may guide this development. Further experiments will be required to determine different concentrations of gelatine and their accuracy at representing the heterogeneous nature organs of the human body. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Anatomical modelling; Ballistics; Ordnance gelatine; Tissue simulants; Trauma,"gelatin; abdomen; accuracy; anatomical variation; animal tissue; Article; ballistics; biomechanics; bullet; energy; firearm; heart tissue; kidney tissue; liver tissue; lung parenchyma; mass; nonhuman; pig; priority journal; thorax; velocity; animal; animal model; ballistics; biological model; comparative study; gunshot injury; infrared radiation; pig; procedures; telecommunication; videorecording; Animals; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Infrared Rays; Models, Animal; Models, Biological; Radar; Swine; Video Recording; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046649304,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

Since the ballistic gelatin used in present has important issues to overcome, an alternative approach is the use of gelatin-polymer composites, where a key factor is the insertion of biocompatible materials, which replicate accurately the human tissues. In order to be able to obtain an improved material in terms of mechanical performances by an easy industrial-scale technology, before the verification of the ballistic parameters by shooting in agreement with military standards, one of the best and cheapest solutions is to perform a thorough check of their rheological properties, in standard conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Ballistic behavior; Hybrid composite; Simulant of human tissues,"gelatin; aging; animal tissue; Article; biocompatibility; biodegradation; bulk density; chemical analysis; chemical structure; controlled study; flow kinetics; forensic science; humidity; nonhuman; physical chemistry; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reproducibility; synthesis; viscoelasticity; water temperature; Young modulus; ballistics; biological model; human; materials testing; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Humans; Materials Testing; Models, Biological; Rheology",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973170707,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

After having obtained very good results for a new gelatin-based composite in terms of physicochemical and rheological properties, this study focused on this material's mechanical behavior during stabbing and shooting versus bovine and porcine organs and standard ballistic gelatin. The hybrid gelatin has a predominantly elastic behavior at 23°C, whereas the elastic modulus becomes practically constant in the 10–0.1 Hz frequency range. In terms of stabbing behavior, the small variations obtained between porcine organs and surrogate are below 5%, the perforation indicating a good similarity.

When relatively small blocks are used as substitute for a head, problems with regard to the expansion of the gelatine block could arise. The study was conducted to analyse the influence of the material the gelatine block is placed upon. Thirty-six shots were performed on 12 cm gelatine cubes doped with thin foil bags containing acrylic paint. Eighteen blocks each were placed on a rigid table or on a synthetic sponge of 5 cm height. Deforming bullets with different kinetic energies were fired from distance and recorded by a high-speed video camera. Subsequently, the gelatine cubes were cut into 1 cm thick slices which were scanned using a flatbed scanner. Cracks in the gelatine were analysed by measuring the longest crack, Fackler’s wound profile and the polygon (perimeter and area) outlining the ends of the cracks. The energy dissipated ranged from 153 to 707 J. For moderate energy transfer, no significant influence of the sustaining material was discerned. With increasing dissipated energy, the sponge was compressed correspondingly, and the cracks were longer than in gelatine blocks which had been placed on a table. High-speed video revealed a loss of symmetry and a flattened inferior margin of the temporary cavity with energies superior to approx. Two hundred Joules when the blocks were placed on a rigid platform. However, 12 cm gelatine cubes showed material limits by a non-linear response when more than 400 J were dissipated for both rigid and elastic sustainment. In conclusion, the smaller the gelatine blocks and the greater the energy transfers, the more important it is to take into account the counterfort of the sustaining material. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Energy transfer; High-speed video; Simulants; Temporary cavity; Wound ballistics,"gelatin; ballistics; biological model; gunshot injury; human; kinetics; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Humans; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020693017,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

Accurate BFD quantification is critical for the assessment and certification of personal protective equipment, such as body armor and helmets, and ballistic evaluation. A common witness material is ballistic clay, specifically, Roma Plastilina No. 1 (RP1). RP1 must be heated to nearly 38 °C to pass calibration, and used within a limited time frame to remain in calibration. RP1 also exhibits lot-to-lot variability and is sensitive to time, temperature, and handling procedures, which limits the BFD accuracy and reproducibility. A new silicone composite backing material (SCBM) was developed and tested side-by-side with heated RP1 using quasi-static indentation and compression, low velocity impact, spherical projectile penetration, and both soft and hard armor ballistic BFD measurements to compare their response over a broad range of strain rates and temperatures. The results demonstrate that SCBM mimics the heated RP1 response at room temperature and exhibits minimal temperature sensitivity. With additional optimization of the composition and processing, SCBM could be a drop-in replacement for RP1 that is used at room temperature during BFD quantification with minimal changes to the current RP1 handling protocols and infrastructure. It is anticipated that removing the heating requirement, and temperature-dependence, associated with RP1 will reduce test variability, simplify testing logistics, and enhance test range productivity. © 2018",Armor certification; Back face signature; Ballistic body armor acceptance; Ballistic clay; Roma Plastilina No. 1,silicone; accuracy; Article; back face deformation; ballistics; calibration; face deformity; heating; human; priority journal; reaction optimization; reproducibility; room temperature; temperature dependence; temperature sensitivity,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041692106,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

The relationship between caliber, wound diameter, and bone mineral density (BMD) was examined. The formation of the permanent cavity is influenced by bullet yaw, velocity, distance, and tissue properties. The hypothesis was that including BMD, wound diameter could be explained by differences in caliber. The sample consists of 68 autopsy sections and 101 specimens from Phelps (1898). A subsample of 18 was scanned using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for BMD measurement to test whether an increase in BMD affects wound diameter. Pearson product-moment correlations of the subsample indicate the strongest correlation is between BMD and minimum diameter (r = 0.7101), followed by a correlation between minimum diameter and caliber (r = 0.6854). Despite the previous use of thickness as a proxy for BMD, no correlation was found between BMD and thickness (r = 0.0143). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) detected a significant influence of BMD and minimum diameter on caliber size (Prob > F = 0.0003). The logistic regression shows that caliber can be estimated from minimum diameter. Using the subsample, the results show that the inclusion of BMD strengthens the model for estimating caliber from entrance gunshot defects. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",BMD; Caliber; Cranial; Gunshot; Wounding potential,"ballistics; bone density; diagnostic imaging; firearm; gunshot injury; human; injuries; multivariate analysis; pathology; photon absorptiometry; skull; Absorptiometry, Photon; Bone Density; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Skull; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979555069,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

The models were subjected to ballistic impact from 7.62 × 39 mm mild steel core bullets. The first part of the work compares the different polyurethanes (mean bullet muzzle velocity of 708 m/s), and the second part compares the different fills (mean bullet muzzle velocity of 680 m/s). The impact events were filmed using high speed cameras. The resulting fracture patterns in the skulls were reviewed and scored by five clinicians experienced in assessing penetrating head injury. In over half of the models, one or more assessors felt aspects of the fracture pattern were close to real injury. Limitations of the model include the skull being manufactured in two parts and the lack of a realistic skin layer.

However, the majority of these studies have been conducted on both post-mortem human subjects (PMHS) and animal surrogates which have constraints in terms of storage, preparation and testing. The identification of a validated bone surrogate for use in forensic, medical and engineering testing would provide the ability to investigate ballistic loading without these constraints. Two specific bone surrogates, Sawbones and Synbone, were evaluated in comparison to PMHS for both direct and indirect ballistic loading. For the direct loading, the mean velocity to produce fracture was 121 ± 19 m/s for the PMHS, which was statistically different from the Sawbones (140 ± 7 m/s) and Synbone (146 ± 3 m/s). The average distance to fracture in the indirect loading was .70 cm for the PMHS. The Synbone had a statistically similar average distance to fracture (61 cm, p = 0.54) however the Sawbones average distance to fracture was statistically different (41 cm, p < 0.05). Fractures patterns were found to be comparable to the PMHS for tests conducted with Synbones, however the input parameters were slightly varied to produce similar results. The fractures patterns with the Sawbones were not found to be as comparable to the PMHS.

Handguns are often used in violent deaths such as suicides and homicides. Hence, ballistic trauma is a critical subject of forensic investigations. Trauma patterns are fundamental evidence for the reconstruction of the incident and for the determination of the manner of death. This study investigated the differences in trauma patterns with a series of experiments using six different calibers (.22 LR,.38 Special,.380 ACP, 9 × 19 mm,.40 S&amp;W, and.45 ACP) and four different bullet types. Synbone® spheres (polyurethane bone proxies) were used for close range 30 cm simulated executions. The polyurethane spheres constitute an excellent proxy for human crania at the macroscopic level as suggested by other studies. The results showed that the radius of the entrance wound is positively correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient R = 0.846, p &lt; 0.05) with the caliber dimension. As muzzle velocity increased, endocranial beveling increased. Bullet weight, conversely, does not seem to have an effect on the size of the endocranial beveling present in Synbone® spheres. The ballistic experiments exhibited similarities in entrance wound morphology; radial and concentric fracture patterns, hydraulic burst effect, circumferential delamination, and endocranial beveling with that of documented forensic cases with corresponding caliber shot. Synbone spheres seem appropriate for ballistic simulations of cranial injuries; yet, more research is needed to verify these observations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Ballistics; Cranial trauma; Execution; Gunshot wound; Polyurethane spheres; Synbone,"polyurethan; polyurethan; Article; ballistics; bullet; bullet weight; caliber; circumferential delamination; clinical feature; controlled study; correlation coefficient; endocranial beveling; forensic anthropology; gunshot injury; hydraulic burst effect; measurement; microfractures; priority journal; radius; radius fracture; skull injury; tattooing; velocity; Wallner line; weapon; biological model; firearm; gunshot injury; head injury; human; procedures; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Head Injuries, Penetrating; Humans; Models, Biological; Polyurethanes; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036586352,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

In these cases, the gas jet perforates the skin leaving an entrance wound similar to that from a conventional gun. In order to investigate the wound morphology in contact shots from blank firearms, test shots were fired at composite models of pig skin and gelatin blocks using three different calibre 9-mm blank cartridge handguns (two pistols and one revolver) and two types of ammunition. It turned out that the penetrating gas jet produced roundish skin defects resembling bullet entrance holes. Small skin particles from the perforation site were dispersed in the underlying simulant where radiating cracks containing greyish gunshot residues indicated the original expansion of the inrushing combustion gases. Apart from the size of the permanent entrance hole in the skin and the final position of the displaced tissue particles, the penetration depth of the gas jet was determined. Under the specified conditions of the test shots, the zone of mechanical destruction within the simulant was 2.2 to 6.1 cm in length, which illustrates the injuring potential of contact shots inflicted with blank cartridge handguns. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Alarm gun; Blank cartridge; Composite model; Contact shot; Gas jet; Penetration depth; Skin hole; Starter’s pistol,"gelatin; animal; animal model; ballistics; biological model; firearm; gunshot injury; human; injuries; pathology; pig; skin; Animals; Firearms; Forensic Ballistics; Gelatin; Humans; Models, Animal; Models, Biological; Skin; Swine; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024499010,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

A recent trauma case presenting with a penetrating chest injury occasioned an investigation into the basic ballistic parameters of this type of weapon. Kinetic energy E of the test projectiles was calculated between 5.8 and 12.5 J. Energy density ED of the test projectiles was close to or higher than the threshold energy density of human skin. It can be concluded that penetrating skin injuries due to free-flying rubber ball projectiles discharged at close range cannot be ruled out. However, in case of a contact shot, the main injury potential of this weapon type must be attributed to the high energy density of the muzzle gas jet which may, similar to well-known gas or alarm weapons, cause life-threatening or even lethal injuries. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Alarm weapon; Blank cartridge; Gas weapon; Muzzle gas pressure; Rubber ball,"rubber; adult; ballistics; case report; diagnostic imaging; foreign body; gunshot injury; human; kinetics; male; pathology; statistics; thorax injury; Adult; Foreign Bodies; Forensic Ballistics; Humans; Kinetics; Male; Rubber; Statistics as Topic; Thoracic Injuries; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019869475,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

In a research project concerning staining inside the barrel, the influence of the powder pocket on these traces was investigated. According to the ‘triple contrast method’, thin pads containing a mixture of acrylic paint, radiocontrast agent and blood were glued on plastic boxes which were coated with a 3–4-mm-thick silicone layer.

Thirty-three contact shots were realized using different pistols and 22 lr,.32 auto,.38 special and 9-mm Luger with different barrel length using subsonic, non-deforming ammunition. The documentation comprised endoscopy, high speed video and computer tomography (CT) of the target models. Using image analysis, the ballooning of the silicone coat was studied (lateral view projection). High-speed video confirmed the actual comprehension of the behaviour of muzzle gases in contact shots. The powder cavity rises in about 1.5 to 2 ms, preceding the maximum of the temporary cavity, and the powder pocket’s collapse takes 2.5 to 3 ms. The size of the silicone dome increased with decreasing barrel length.

The experimental design allowed the bullet to pass-through an implant and into ballistics gel (n = 10) or into ballistics gel without passage through an implant (n = 11). Shots that passed through an implant had 20.6% decreased penetration distance when compared to shots that did not pass-through an implant; this difference was statistically significant (31.9 cm vs. 40.2 cm, p < 0.001). Implant group bullets mushroomed prior to gel entry, but the no implant group mushroomed within the gel.

In this study, the real frequency of such a peculiar feature was investigated. The presence of “chipping” was assessed on 22 gunshot wounds fired at a near-contact range on bovine ribs with 9-mm bullets. As controls, five samples were shot with a 3 cm range, and five from 40 cm. In 77% of cases shot at near-contact range, a detachment of small fragments of the upper layers of bone was detected, mainly with a circumferential disposition, whereas this feature was lacking in control samples. The study demonstrated the frequency of “chipping” and that it may probably be due to a combined ballistic effect of impact of the bullet itself and expansion of gases. It may be thus considered indicative of close-range shots. © 2016 American Academy of Forensic Sciences",beveling; bone; chipping; entrance wounds; forensic pathology; forensic science; gunshot wounds,"animal; animal model; ballistics; bovine; forensic pathology; gunshot injury; injuries; pathology; rib; Animals; Cattle; Forensic Ballistics; Forensic Pathology; Models, Animal; Ribs; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006789967,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

They may be due either to anatomical reasons or to diverse cogent ballistic arguments. The reported case pertains to a fatal hunting accident involving an expanded conical point bullet against the neck with both atypical entrance and exit wounds. Ballistic analyses including test firings allowed a better understanding of the external and internal findings. Upon premature impact with an intermediary target, the bullet experienced expansion in the formation of sharp brass petals responsible for a star-shaped entry wound. The trajectory of the deformed high energy projectile through the victim's body was then deviated by the cervical column, causing it to be tangential to the skin when exiting the body.

These measurements, in turn, allowed reasonable estimates of a 9mm bullet’s impact velocity at the victim’s location on the opposite side of the lake. These results were compared to the bullet’s calculated impact velocity for a direct shot. Only the latter would explain the gunshot wound sustained by the victim.

However, due to the fact that PMCT is not routinely performed in all countries, in cases of death abroad it can happen that a CT scan is performed only after a first autopsy. A case of post-mortem re-examination, including the external examination and a post-autopsy computed tomography (PACT), of a gunshot victim of homicide in a foreign country is presented, and the pros and cons of imaging in post-autopsy setting are discussed. PACT could be a tool for carrying out more complete investigations and for obtaining information on bone injuries and foreign bodies trapped within peripheral soft tissues that can be re-analyzed after the arrival of the first autopsy report. Given that the value of information derived may be strongly influenced by the previously performed autopsy, in order to process the definitive considerations it is necessary to compare and interpret the data obtained through PACT with the results of the first autopsy, and to continue the international cooperation effort and the application of international guidelines in order to share information at the repatriation of the corpse. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Firearm; Forensic imaging; Gunshot; PACT; PMCT,"Article; autopsy; bone injury; case report; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; foreign body; forensic medicine; gunshot injury; homicide; human; human tissue; image analysis; image reconstruction; international cooperation; priority journal; risk benefit analysis; soft tissue disease; artifact; autopsy; comminuted fracture; diagnostic imaging; gunshot injury; procedures; rib fracture; three dimensional imaging; whole body imaging; x-ray computed tomography; Artifacts; Autopsy; Foreign Bodies; Fractures, Comminuted; Homicide; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Rib Fractures; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Whole Body Imaging; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019195499,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

Case Report: The body of a 28-year-old man was found in the jungle in supine position with both legs apart. A trap gun was between the legs pointing toward the cranial side of the body. It had 2 free wires that were not connected together. There was no evidence of foul play. The body had a single-entry wound (2.5-cm diameter) in the anterior chest, with blackening, burning, and tattooing. Six metal particles and nylon clothing material were embedded into soft tissue. No exit wound was found. Toxicology analysis reported an alcohol level of 72mg/dL. The cause of death was multiple shrapnel injury to the chest at close to intermediate range by a single discharge from a trap gun. Circumstance was concluded as suicide. Ballistic and firearm experts opined that an illegal, manually operated, battery-powered ignition device was used to ignite the gun powder.

This might lead to the conclusion that such cases are extremely rare. However, there are cases again and yet again. During the investigation process, the modified gun is of particular importance since it can show an unusual ballistic behaviour. The present paper reports on a suicide of a 60-year-old man, committed with a modified revolver and a lead bullet. The man had a single gunshot wound with entrance at the right temporal bone. Autopsy revealed that the bullet had fragmented into two major parts. The smaller one stood outside the cranial cavity and pushed its way alongside between the cranial bone and scalp to its end position in the left temporal area. The bigger part entered the cranial cavity and ended in the left parietal lobe. In shots on ballistic soap and on a head-model, the ballistics of the weapon and lead bullet were characterized. The angle necessary for bullet fragmentation was determined by shots on ballistic soap and turned out to be 55°–60° at a velocity of around 200 m/s. This knowledge was transferred to contact shots on a head-model consisting of a layered polyurethane sphere filled with 10 % ballistic gelatine and covered with a skin-like cap almost all around. The resulting injury pattern corresponded to the one of the suicide person. The bigger bullet part entered the skull while the smaller part pushed its way alongside between skin and skull causing an outer contour shot. Furthermore, the revolver was documented firing off two bullets by one trigger pull—a phenomenon of importance for forensic casework the authors have not found reported in forensic literature. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Ballistics; Bullet fragmentation; Contour shot; Gunshot injury; Modified gun; Suicide,"ballistics; biological model; case report; gunshot injury; human; injuries; male; middle aged; pathology; procedures; suicide; temporal bone; Forensic Ballistics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Suicide; Temporal Bone; Wounds, Gunshot",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991373504,,IFSMS 2019,Firearms,Firearms

We present a case of a 28-year old man, who was found dead in his car. Because of an unusual position of the firearm, which was clamped into the steering wheel, and an unclear entrance/exit wound, an autopsy was performed. The deceased showed typical signs of a contact shotgun wound to the head with an entrance wound in the right temporal region and an exit wound in the midface. With the help of gunpowder attachments and a muzzle imprint at the entrance site, a wound channel from the right lower posterior part of the temporal region to the left anterior part of the mid-facial region could be reconstructed. The stellate wound in the midface was assessed as an atypical exit wound.

Because of the length of the weapon, which was apparently used and found at the scene, a suicidal manner of death first seemed unlikely and the possibility of a simulated suicide was raised. It seemed impossible for the decedent to have shot himself without a mechanism to launch the shaft through the mouth.
