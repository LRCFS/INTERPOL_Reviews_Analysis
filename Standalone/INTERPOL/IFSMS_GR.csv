Criminologie, U., Lausanne-Dorigny, Switzerland","A review of the scientific papers published on inorganic gunshot residue (GSR) analysis permits to study how the particle analysis has shown its capability in detection and identification of gunshot residue. The scanning electron microscope can be the most powerful tool for forensic scientists to determine the proximity to a discharging firearm and/or the contact with a surface exposed to GSR. Particle analysis can identify individual gunshot residue particles through both morphological and elemental characteristics. When particles are detected on the collected sample, the analytical results can be interpreted following rules of a formal general interpretative system, to determine whether they come from the explosion of a primer or from other possible sources. The particles on the sample are compared with an abstract idea of ""unique"" GSR particle produced by the sole source of the explosion of a primer. ""Uniqueness"" is not the only problem related to GSR detection and identification for a forensic scientist. With ""not-unique"" particles interpretation of results is extremely important. The evidential strength of ""not-unique"" particles can increase with a more fruitful interpretative framework based on Bayes rule. For the assessment of the value of a GSR in linking a suspect and a crime, it is important to compare two hypothesis: the first can be that of the evidence if the suspect has been shooting in a specific situation, the second that of the evidence if the suspect was not involved in this shooting. This case specific or case-by-case approach is closer to what the court is interested in. The authors consider that a ""case-by-case"" approach should be followed whenever possible. Research of models and data such as those developed in other trace evidence material (fibres, glass, etc.) using a Bayesian approach is suggested in the interpretation of GSR.

In order to better define the origin of these particles, brake linings and their wear products were examined by SEM-EDX. The results obtained demonstrate that some types of brake linings contain lead, barium, and antimony and that they can represent a source of particles showing GSR-like elemental profiles. Most of these particles can be easily discriminated from primer discharge residue because of the high levels of iron or the presence of ""prohibited"" elements in the spectrum. However, particles with iron at minor or trace levels and lacking ""prohibited"" elements were also found. It is thus advisable to use caution when describing the composition of similar particles as ""unique"" to primer discharge residue.

As residues from these primers do not contain lead, barium, and antimony, they cannot be uniquely classified as gunshot residue (GSR) under ASTM designation E 1588-95. In many types of 0.22 caliber rimfire ammunition, the cartridge contains a primer sensitized with glass. In this paper we describe a previously unreported type of GSR particle consisting of glass fused with other primer components. As there appear to be few potential environmental or occupational sources of particles composed of lead and barium compounds fused to glass, particularly borosilicate glass, these particles may have high evidential value. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray detection (SEM-EDX) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) were evaluated for the characterization of glass-containing GSR particles.

Six persons who normally have no contact with weapons fired three times, each person from a different pistol. Samples of gunshot residues were collected from the shooters' hands using aluminium stubs with black carbon adhesive tabs and subjected to examinations of their morphology and elemental content by means of a scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer in an automatic manner. In a comparative study of the samples, only primer residues were taken into account. The frequency of occurrence of particles representing a certain chemical class against the total number of detected particles was expressed as a percentage. Mutual relations between the frequencies of occurrence of the residues of particular chemical content were found to be different for most of the studied ammunition types using a non-statistical approach - and by means of non-parametric statistical methods (R-Spearman and Ï„-Kendall correlation coefficients), it was possible to differentiate one ammunition type from each of the other ammunition types examined. The performed examinations have revealed some differences in the frequencies of occurrence of certain chemical classes of primer residues, observed for various types of ammunition. These differences could constitute a valuable contribution to group identifications of ammunition made on the basis of physical and chemical examinations of gunshot residues.

The objective of the program is to produce instruments and communication networks that have application within both NASA's space program and NIJ programs with state and local forensic laboratories. A working group of NASA scientists and law enforcement professionals has been established to develop and implement a feasibility demonstration program. Specifically, the group has focused its efforts on identifying gunpowder and primer residue, blood, and semen at crime scenes. Non-destructive elemental composition identification methods are carried out using portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) systems. These systems are similar to those being developed for planetary exploration programs. A breadboard model of a portable XRF system has been constructed for these tests using room temperature silicon and cadmium-zinc telluride (CZT) detectors. Preliminary tests have been completed with gunshot residue (GSR), blood-spatter and semen samples. Many of the element composition lines have been identified. Studies to determine the minimum detectable limits needed for the analyses of GSR, blood and semen in the crime scene environment have been initiated and preliminary results obtained. Furthermore, a database made up of the inorganic composition of GSR is being developed. Using data obtained from the open literature of the elemental composition of barium (Ba) and antimony (Sb) in handswipes of GSR, we believe that there may be a unique GSR signature based on the Sb to Ba ratio.

Therefore not only the spectrum of chemographic methods for the visualization of primer-GSR (PGSR) has to be controlled and optimized steadily, but also a consistent improvement of the collection methods has to take place. Recent progress in collecting GSR from a shooter's hands will be presented starting with the application of a viscose solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL), a method that was introduced to German forensic laboratories about 10 years ago. As this method is very time-consuming, a much more convenient technique was developed using transparent adhesive film for the sampling process. Both methods find their application in the collection of P-GSR. Special emphasis will be placed on the chemographic handling of P-GSR originating from the lead-free SintoxTM ammunition of the Dynamit Nobel AG. The main elements zinc and titanium are not easily detected because titanium is not readily converted into a colored complex, whereas zinc is ubiquitous. So far several methods have been tested to reliably visualize the zinc compound. A new method is described to test for PGSR sampled from a shooter's hand by means of an acidic xylenolorange solution forming a colored zinc complex.","chemography, chlorindazone DS, dithizone, Filmolux, gunshot residues, P-GSR, polyvinyl alcohol, PVAL, Sintox, titanium, xylenolorange, zinc, zincon",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2004,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

The components contained in the double-based smokeless powder were separated by using a HPLC system with UV detection at 223 nm. The result indicated that there are mainly two kinds of organic ingredients in the double-base smokeless powder used. These two organics do not include nitrocellulose because it has no evidential value in the HPLC-UV trace of the smokeless powder sample. By matching retention times of these two compounds with that of the five standards occurring in smokeless powder, the compounds are tentatively identified as methyl centralite (MC) and nitroglycerin (NG). These two compounds were finally identified by using MS spectrum. This MS-MS method was developed to detect MC since MC is less commonly found in the environment than NG. In Chinese ammunition, MC is widely used as a stabilizer instead of EC. Sixteen samples were used to evaluate the reliability of the method. The mean (Â±SD) MC level in the eight samples is 520.1 Â± 271.9 pg/Î¼L and that in the blanks is 31.0 Â± 20.8 pg/Î¼L. The result (P = 0.0007) shows that there is a significant difference between the two serial data. Sampling hands over a 24 h period showed that GSR could be detected even after 8 h with a 75% decrease in the level of MC. The result of the washing test shows that it is still possible to apply the proposed method to detect GSRs on a shooter's hands even if their hands have been washed three times. Another test shows that if the shooters wear gloves while firing, MC on the gloves can be easily detected using the proposed method.",Forensic science; Gunshot residues; Methyl centralite; Tandem mass spectrometry,glyceryl trinitrate; gunpowder; article; Chinese; forensic science; gunshot injury; high performance liquid chromatography; priority journal; sampling; tandem mass spectrometry; ultraviolet spectroscopy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034989911,,IFSMS 2004,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

Conductive and non-conductive double-side adhesives were examined, and the analysis was carried out by gas chromatography/thermal energy analyzer (GC/TEA) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). The optimal procedure for the extraction, as was developed in the present study, employs two stages: (1) extraction of the stubs with a mixture of 80% v/v aqueous solution of 0.1% w/v of sodium azide and 20% v/v of ethanol employing sonication at 80Â°C for 15 min. and (2) residues from the obtained extract were further extracted with methylene chloride. The methylene chloride phase was concentrated by evaporation prior to analysis. Extraction efficiencies of 30-90% for nitroglycerine (NG) and for 2,4-dinitro toluene (2,4-DNT) were found. No significant interferences in the analysis were observed from the adhesives or skin. Interferences were observed in the analysis by the GC/TEA of the samples collected from hair.

The purpose of this project was to develop MECE for implementation in gunshot residue casework. Studies were designed to provide data for evaluating casework samples. The first study compared the results of MECE analysis of organic gunshot residues (O-GSR) from firing range samples, to SEM results for inorganic GSR (I-GSR). MECE analysis found detectable O-GSR for each caliber of weapon examined except for the .22 caliber weapon. SEM analysis confirmed the presence of I-GSR in selected samples where O-GSR was identified by MECE, as well as vaporous lead for the .22 caliber sample. Repetitive firing experiments demonstrated that detectable O-GSR were not deposited each time the same weapon was fired under the same conditions. This leads to the conclusion that residue deposition mechanisms and collection efficiency significantly effect the outcome of O-GSR analyses. Another study found that detectable O-GSR do not persist for more than an hour after firing (under the conditions examined). Decomposition of O-GSR from environmental exposure occurs at a rate that is slow compared to residue persistence, thus, the value of O-GSR composition is not compromised by short term exposure.

Visualization of these impressions is possible by spraying the palms with a solution of 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine (PDT), which forms a magenta complex with iron(II) residues. Hence, mark intensity is directly related to the amounts of iron transferred to the palm. Palmar sweat plays a major role in iron transfer from the firearm to the hand. More factors, however, are involved in this process. Three time-dependent factors have been studied with relation to their effect on the developed mark: the gripping duration of the weapon; the time elapsed from the contact; and the rate of iron dissolution in aqueous solutions containing sweat components in physiological concentrations. We found that the amounts of iron transferred to the palm depend on both, the gripping period and the levels of palmar moisture. Thus, only a few seconds of gripping were required for developing good marks (corresponding to 80 ng cm-2 of iron) on highly-moistured hands, much longer gripping periods were necessary for developing marks of similar intensity on relatively dry hands. Experiments that aimed at studying the effect of sweat components on metallic iron dissolution were carried out in aqueous solutions. It was found that chloride ions in physiological concentrations remarkably enhanced the dissolution, while l-serine, the major amino acid in palmar sweat, had a detrimental effect on this process. Urea, another sweat component, had only a minor effect on the dissolution rate. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In past work, the P/S values of handgun OGSR and cartridges loaded with known gunpowders were evaluated. In this study, gunpowder and residue samples were obtained from seven boxes of commercial 38 caliber ammunition with the goals of associating cartridges within a box and matching residues to unfired powders, based on the P/S value and the qualitative identity of the additives. Gunpowder samples from four of the seven boxes of ammunition could be easily differentiated. When visual comparisons of the cartridge powders were considered in addition to composition, powder samples from all seven boxes of ammunition could be reliably differentiated. Handgun OGSR was also collected and evaluated in bulk as well as for individual particles. In some cases, residues could be reliably differentiated based on P/S and additive identity. It was instructive to evaluate the composition of individual unfired gunpowder and OGSR particles. We determined that both the numerical centroid and dispersity of the P/S measurements provide information for associations and exclusions.

Samples involved lead projectiles removed from the deceased's head and a pillow, lead-rich scrapings and particles (gunshot residues) from spent cartridges and a silencer, and particles from a pillowcase. The lead projectiles had the same isotopic composition, with the lead being derived from the same dominantly geologically old source(s). The lead smear from the silencer had the same isotopic composition as the projectiles, and the lead was probably from the same source. The particles from the spent cartridges had varying elemental compositions ranging from PbO to PbCuZn Â±Ba with or without Si and are consistent with derivation from the primer. The lead isotopic compositions of the particles from the spent cartridges show some variations, but these are markedly different from those of the projectiles, indicating lead from a mixture of geologically old and geologically young lead. The particles from the pillowcase were extremely small (usually <50 Î¼m size) and showed varying isotopic compositions, some consistent with the gunshot residue from the cartridges. As the exhibits had been handled extensively prior to the present investigation, including some being sent to North America, there is a high likelihood that handling was not done in clean room environments and may have been contaminated. In this instance, as we were concerned about contamination, especially of the pillowcase, we felt contamination negated use of the results for assistance in proving the innocence or guilt of the accused. A combination of high-precision lead isotope measurements with scanning electron microscopy provides a powerful tool for forensic investigations if precautions are taken in handling the exhibits.",Contamination; Forensic science; Homicide; Lead isotopes; SEM,"barium; copper; lead; silicon; zinc; accuracy; article; bed; chemical analysis; chemical composition; contamination; environmental factor; forensic science; grain; homicide; molecular weight; particle size; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; Firearms; Forensic Anthropology; Homicide; Humans; Isotopes; Lead; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Reproducibility of Results; Specimen Handling",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036379862,,IFSMS 2004,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

Multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP/MS) was used to analyze lead isotopic compositions in projectiles, cartridge cases, firearms discharge residues (FDR) in barrels of firearms and in the gunshot entries. .22 caliber plain lead and plated ammunition and 9 mm Luger full metal jacket (FMJ) ammunition were employed in shooting experiments using semiautomatic pistols. Cotton cloth served as the target material and two firing distances were tested; 1 cm (near contact) and 2 m distances. It was observed that various mechanical or chemical means of cleaning do not completely remove lead deposits (""lead memory"") from barrels of firearms. Nonetheless, it was shown that analysis of lead isotopic composition may provide valuable evidence in investigating specific scenarios of shooting incidents. For instance in a shoot-out where several firearms and ammunition brands are involved, it may be feasible to point out which ammunition and/or firearm caused a particular gunshot entry if the ammunition brands involved (bullets and primers) differ considerably in their lead isotopic composition.

The amount of this compound was very low in short-barreled small arms and its escape from the barrel could generally be measured for only a few days or up to two weeks after the latest discharge. To improve the detection of TEA2 compound, the SPME sampling time was prolonged and fibers coated by Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane were used. The decrease of the TEA2 peak with time after shooting from pistols is nonexponential but the curve-fitting procedure proposed for the estimation of time since discharge of shotguns and rifles is difficult to apply as the decay is very rapid. Therefore, the detection of TEA2 compounds in small arms should be interpreted that the firearm had been used very recently.

Attendees agreed that GSR originates in part from the firearm, the cartridge case, and the bullet, with most of the inorganic residue coming from the primer. Most agreed that despite the combination of potential sources that could contribute to the formation of detectable residues, the best term to describe these particles is ""gunshot residue"" rather than such terms as ""primer residue"" or ""cartridge discharge residue."" The majority of attendees indicated that when two-component particles are identified in the absence of three-component particles, they would indicate the presence of these particles in their laboratory reports. Almost all participants indicated that particle morphology, elemental composition, and a comparison of any known residue from ammunition involved in the case should be considered when categorizing particles as GSR. All participants agreed that GSR sampling should be done at the scene where possible and as quickly as possible. It was widely agreed that the average person who was not exposed to firearms or ammunition or its components would not have GSR particles on their hands. Other issues addressed in this summary of the symposium are case-acceptance criteria, the testing of victims and suspected suicides, testing clothing, ""instant shooter"" identification kits, significance and report writing, technical review, and proficiency testing. 33 references and appended list of symposium attendees",Police policies and procedures,Evidence collection; Gunshot residue; Investigative techniques; Report writing; Trace evidence,Conference material,,,,,,IFSMS 2007,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

These particles were found to have an average velocity of 500 to 600 ft per second. Many particles acquired considerably higher velocities. Thus, the particles have sufficient energy to embed themselves within certain nearby targets like skin or fabric. The relatively high velocity that the particles acquire explain the formation of stippling on skin in close proximity to a muzzle discharge. These findings also indicate little influence of air currents on particle behavior near the muzzle. The deceleration of less than 100 particles during a 100-microsecond interval was also calculated. The particles experienced rapid rates of deceleration which would explain why few particles are found in test firings beyond 3 ft from the muzzle of a discharged firearm.

Haag, Forensic Science Services, Carefree, AZ, Jon Tew, Arizona Department of Public Safety Crime Laboratory, Phoenix, AZ","Although the muzzle is the primary source of gunshot residues in revolvers, the cylinder gap is a source of a small amount of very energetic gunshot residues. These emerge from both sides of a revolver just after the base of the bullet passes this location when the internal pressures of discharge are near their peak. Cylinder gap spacing in a properly configured revolver is typically on the order of 0.004 to 0.006 inches. The appearance and location of cylinder gap residues and the spatial relationship of these residues to gunshot residues from the muzzle of a revolver have well-known reconstructive value but it is the possible affect of significant variations in cylinder gap spacing on the residues emerging from the muzzle that were the subject of this research. For this purpose a Dan Wesson 357 Magnum revolver was used. The design of this brand of firearm allows the cylinder gap spacing to be adjusted over a wide range of values. Witness panels placed at fixed distances to the side of the cylinder gap and in front of the muzzle of the test revolver were used to record the GSR deposits at selected cylinder gap settings. A ballistic chronograph was employed to measure the effects of cylinder gap variation on bullet velocity. Small variations in cylinder gap spacing had no detectable effect on muzzle GSR or projectile velocity. Large departures from normal cylinder gap spacing had significant effects on muzzle residues, bullet velocity, and cylinder gap discharge and even resulted in physical damage to the bullets as they transited the cylinder gap.","Gunshot residue, GSR, revolvers, cylinder gap, cylinder gap residue",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2007,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

The GSR test results are used to associate the suspect with primary exposure to GSR. The potential for these vehicles and facilities being sources of secondary GSR contamination needed to be determined. A total of 201 samples were collected from randomly selected vehicles and detention facilities. The sampling collected trace materials from surfaces that suspects' hands may contact during the arrest process. These samples were examined for the presence of GSR particles using scanning electron microscopy. Upon completion of the automated analysis, those particles that met an initial GSR screening criterion were relocated and reanalyzed. The locations where GSR particles were recovered allowed us to make recommendations to the Chicago Police Department with regard to transporting and detaining these suspects. The low number of GSR particles recovered suggests that the potential for secondary contamination, although present, is relatively low.

Particular attention is drawn to the coherent handling of uncertainties associated with the various parameters considered within each item of evidence. The proposed analysis relies on a probabilistic viewpoint that uses graphical models (i.e., Bayesian networks) as an aid to cope with the complexity induced by the number of variables considered. The paper discusses how an approach based on a probabilistic network environment can be used for the formal analysis and construction of arguments.

If two hypotheses are taken into account (""the suspect has shot a firearm"" and ""the suspect has not shot a firearm""), the likelihood ratio of the conditional probabilities of finding a number n of GSRs is defined. Choosing two Poisson distributions, the parameter Î» of the first one coincides with the mean number of GSRs that can be found on a firearm shooter, while the parameter Î¼ of the second one is the mean number of GSRs that can be found on a nonshooter. In this scenario, the likelihood ratio of the conditional probabilities of finding a number n of GSRs in the two hypotheses can be easily calculated. The evaluation of the two parameters Î» and Î¼ and of the goodness of the two probability distributions is performed by using different sets of data: "" exclusive"" lead-antimony-barium GSRs have been detected in two populations of 31 and 28 police officers at diverse fixed times since firearm practice, and in a population of 81 police officers who stated that they had not handled firearms for almost 1 month. The results show that the Poisson distributions well fit the data for both shooters and nonshooters, and that the probability of detection of two or more GSRs is normally greater if the suspect has shot firearms.

Moreover, information on particles taken from cartridge cases shows the relative feeble importance of the morphology in distinguishing gunshot residues (GSRs). Furthermore, also the presence in the spectrum of other elements (e.g., iron) is not so conclusive. In this panorama, the possibility of discriminating gunshot residue particles from other non-firearm lead-antimony-barium aggregates is investigated: the proposed method is based on X-ray mapping technique - currently applied used in Reparto Carabinieri Investigazioni Scientifiche in Rome, the forensic service of Italian Carabinieri - according to which the spatial distribution of the emission energy of each element of the sample is pictured. Gunshot residues present the same lead-antimony-barium distribution (or at least the same antimony-barium distribution with lead nodules), as some other environmental occupational aggregates do not (different plaques of lead, antimony, and barium). So, X-ray mapping technique can offer a new fundamental evaluation parameter in analysis of gunshot residues with scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive (SEM/EDS) spectrometry, and new standards could be considered.

Upon discharge this material is launched from the muzzle of the shotgun with a velocity equal to that of the pellets. Due to its low density, the buffer material loses velocity quickly and is dispersed much more rapidly than the lead pellets. At close range this granular plastic material will produce stippling and tattooing of skin around the entry wound much like that of partially burned and unburned powder. With appropriate test-firings, stippling patterns in skin due to the buffer material can serve as a useful and reliable means of estimating range of fire when integrated with other well-known factors such as soot deposition and pellet behavior.","shotgun wounds, plastic buffer, skin stippling, tattooing, range of fire",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2007,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

In conducting the MGT, the GSR is transferred to treated photographic paper for visualization. A positive reaction yields an orange color on specially treated photographic paper. The examiner also evaluates the size of the powder pattern based on the distribution of nitrite reaction sites or density. A false-positive reaction can occur using the MGT due to contaminants or dyes that produce an orange cloud reaction as well. A method for enhancing visualization of the pattern produced by burned and partially unburned powder is by treatment of the fabric with a solution of sodium hypochlorite. In order to evaluate the results of sodium hypochlorite treatment for GSR visualization, the MGT was used as a reference pattern. Enhancing GSR patterns on dark or multicolored clothing was performed by treating the fabric with an application of 5.25% solution of sodium hypochlorite. Bleaching the dyes in the fabric enhances visualization of the GSR pattern by eliminating the background color. Some dyes are not affected by sodium hypochlorite; therefore, bleaching may not enhance the GSR patterns in some fabrics. Sodium hypochlorite provides the investigator with a method for enhancing GSR patterns directly on the fabric. However, this study is not intended to act as a substitute for the MGT or Sodium Rhodizonate test.

The fabrics were then fired into at a distance of 5.1 cm (2 inches) and 25.5 cm (10 inches), and were analyzed using the Sodium Rhodizonate test to observe any changes in the pattern on the test panels. Lastly, pigskin was fired into and compared to the seven fabric types to determine if one of the fabrics could be used as a suitable alternative for skin. There was considerable variation between all fabrics in the visual and chemical analysis. As the distance increased from 5.1 cm to 12.7 cm to 25.5 cm, the size of the Sodium Rhodizonate patterns decreased on all the fabrics. Cotton was found to be the best simulant for pigskin among all the types of cloth tested.",,,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2007,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue
Jason A.,,Effect of hair on the deposition of gunshot residue,2004,Forensic Science Communications,6,2,,,,,,,http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=240425,,,"Results indicate that the presence of hair can significantly affect the deposition of gunshot residue on skin. Specifically, the results showed that (1) hair could completely prevent the deposition of gunshot residue to the scalp and other hair-covered areas, (2) an entry wound without stippling, sooting, or gunshot residue particles could not be regarded as a distant-range shot without considering the presence of hair as an intervening object, and (3) hair acted as an effective filter and retained gunshot residue. A primary element in the analysis of many shooting incidents is distance determination, the distance from the gun muzzle to the entry wound. The criteria most commonly used in this determination is the presence or absence of gunshot residue. Gunshot residue is defined as visible soot deposit particles. However, common protocols fail to consider the effect that hair may have on the deposition of gunshot residue. This paper examined the hypothesis that the presence of hair could significantly affect the deposition of gunshot residue on skin.

However, seeing and recording gunshot residue patterns can be difficult if the victim's clothing is dark and/or bloodstained. Trostle reported the use of infrared film for the detection of burn patterns. However, only after the film is developed are the results visible and multiple exposures at different settings may be needed. The Video Spectral Comparatorâ„¢ 2000 (Foster & Freeman Ltd., Evesham, Worcestershire, U.K.) is an imaging instrument routinely used by forensic document examiners. Without use of specialized film could the VSC 2000 (at appropriate instrument settings) quickly, easily, and reliably provide instantaneous viewing, saving, and printing of gunshot residue patterns on dark and/or blood soaked clothing? At muzzle-to-target distances of 6, 12, and 18 in., test fires were made into five different types of dark clothing using eight different handguns of different calibers. Gunshot residues were detected for all eight calibers, and powder burn patterns were seen on dark clothing for all three target distances and calibers except 0.22 long rifle and 0.25 ACP.

The recently introduced millimeter-X-ray fluorescence analysis (m-XRF) spectrometer Spectro Midex M offers an easy way to record mappings of GSRs containing such elements in order to determine shooting distances as well as the general composition of these particles. A motorized stage enables samples of a maximum size of 20 a— 20 cm to be investigated, like fabric, clothes, adhesive tapes (FilmoluxÂ® films), and polyvinylalcohol gloves of shooter's hands. Human tissues can be measured using a Peltier-cooled specimen holder that is mounted onto the stage. As the spot size of the exiting X-rays lies in the millimeter range, which is adequate for the assessment of the residue patterns for shooting distance determination, a significant reduction in measurement time is achieved compared with Î¼-XRF methods. Test shots with heavy-metal-free ammunitions were performed on different target materials, like pork skin and fabric, and the elemental distributions of Ti, K, and Ga were determined. In order to show the capability of the spectrometer for conventional lead ammunitions as well, a shot series of 5-100 cm shooting distance and an adhesive tape of a shooter's hand were investigated analogously. A comparison of several methods applied in GSR investigation shows the advantages of the m-XRF method.

The method is based on the characterization and chemical analysis of the smokeless powder particles on the target. An adhesive lifter is applied to collect the suspected gunshot residues (GSRs) from the surface of an object, and a Modified Griess Test (MGT) is carried out after alkaline hydrolysis on the adhesive lifter. Visualized particles are removed from the adhesive lifter under a microscope. Two systems are used for the analysis of organic discharge residues from the smokeless powder: (1) gas chromatography/thermal energy analysis (GC/TEA) for the analysis of nitroglycerine (NG) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), (2) gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the identification of organic components such as DNT, NG, and some stabilizers. By using this procedure and confirming that the suspected particles are indeed GSR, one can estimate the intermediate-long firing distance of c. 0.75-3 m in the presence of very few particles and provide information for the classification of ammunition type in casework.

New methods for the analysis of the organic components of common propellant powder stabilizers were developed based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A multiple reactions monitoring scanning method was created for the screening of akardite II, ethylcentralite, diphenylamine, methylcentralite, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, 2-nitrodiphenylamine, and 4-nitrodiphenylamine, present in standards mixtures. Five out of seven of these target compounds can be selectively identified and distinguished from the two others with a high accuracy. Samples from the hands of a shooter were collected by swabbing and underwent solid phase extraction prior to analysis. Detection limits ranging from 5 to 115 Î¼g injected were achieved. Results from several firing trials show that the LC-MS/MS method is suitable for the detection of stabilizers in samples collected following the firing of 9 mm Para ammunitions.

Conductive and non-conductive double-side adhesives were examined, and the analysis was carried out by gas chromatography/thermal energy analyzer (GC/TEA) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). The optimal procedure for the extraction, as was developed in the present study, employs two stages: (1) extraction of the stubs with a mixture of 80% v/v aqueous solution of 0.1% w/v of sodium azide and 20% v/v of ethanol employing sonication at 80Â°C for 15 min. and (2) residues from the obtained extract were further extracted with methylene chloride. The methylene chloride phase was concentrated by evaporation prior to analysis. Extraction efficiencies of 30-90% for nitroglycerine (NG) and for 2,4-dinitro toluene (2,4-DNT) were found. No significant interferences in the analysis were observed from the adhesives or skin. Interferences were observed in the analysis by the GC/TEA of the samples collected from hair. The method enables analysis of propellant residues on a double-side adhesive coated stub after it was examined for primer residues by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX).

TOF-SIMS was also used to obtain information about the spatial distribution of the various additives contained within the gunpowder samples. SIMS imaging demonstrated that that the samples could potentially be characterized by their 2-D structure, which varied from sample to sample.

Visualization of these impressions is possible by spraying the palms with a solution of 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine (PDT), which forms a magenta complex with iron(II) residues. Hence, mark intensity is directly related to the amounts of iron transferred to the palm. Palmar sweat plays a major role in iron transfer from the firearm to the hand. More factors, however, are involved in this process. Three time-dependent factors have been studied with relation to their effect on the developed mark: the gripping duration of the weapon; the time elapsed from the contact; and the rate of iron dissolution in aqueous solutions containing sweat components in physiological concentrations. We found that the amounts of iron transferred to the palm depend on both, the gripping period and the levels of palmar moisture. Thus, only a few seconds of gripping were required for developing good marks (corresponding to 80 ng cm-2 of iron) on highly-moistured hands, much longer gripping periods were necessary for developing marks of similar intensity on relatively dry hands. Experiments that aimed at studying the effect of sweat components on metallic iron dissolution were carried out in aqueous solutions. It was found that chloride ions in physiological concentrations remarkably enhanced the dissolution, while l-serine, the major amino acid in palmar sweat, had a detrimental effect on this process. Urea, another sweat component, had only a minor effect on the dissolution rate. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, it was shown that analysis of lead isotopic composition may provide valuable evidence in investigating specific scenarios of shooting incidents. For instance in a shoot-out where several firearms and ammunition brands are involved, it may be feasible to point out which ammunition and/or firearm caused a particular gunshot entry if the ammunition brands involved (bullets and primers) differ considerably in their lead isotopic composition.

The increased use of these HMF compositions stands to reduce and ultimately eliminate the presence of lead in gunshot residues and in traditional bullet wipe around the margins of bullet holes. However, considering the long shelf life of ammunition, cartridges with traditional lead styphnate primers will continue to appear in casework for many years to come. This research addressed the situation where a pistol barrel has been fouled with lead-containing ammunition after which one or more rounds of heavy metal-free ammunition are fired. Previous testing by the authors has shown that lead is still detectable in bullet wipe after the discharge of as many as 50 rounds of HMF ammunition. Questions regarding the source of this lead and its persistence are addressed in a relatively simple experiment wherein sections of a lead-contaminated 9mm pistol barrel were removed and examined by SEM/EDX before and after the discharge of 30 rounds of HMF ammunition.","Bullet wipe, BSE imaging, gunshot residue, GSR, heavy metal free primers, HMF primers, SEM/EDX, EDX mapping, WinClean",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2007,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

Such conclusions have been based on the elemental analysis of isolated groups of bullets with no consideration of the metallurgical processes involved in the production and refining of the bullet lead alloys. An understanding of the metallurgy of lead refining reveals that the elements quantified in the forensic analysis are carefully controlled in the refining process and that there are logical reasons why some elements are more discriminatory than others. Data for lead alloys supplied to two major ammunition manufacturers confirm that multiple indistinguishable shipments of lead alloys from secondary lead refiners to the ammunition manufacturers are made each year and over a period of many years. The data also demonstrate that distinguishable compositions can come from the same melt or ""source"" of lead alloy. These results clearly indicate that bullets with indistinguishable compositions could have come from different lead ""sources"" produced in the same or different years. Furthermore, the observation that two bullets have a distinguishable composition does not necessarily mean that they came from a different ""source"". Our results show that the forensic examiner using a method of bullet lead alloy elemental analysis, which quantifies up to six elements is restricted to concluding only that indistinguishable bullets might have come from the same ""source,"" not that they did come from the same ""source"". In addition, it is quite possible that multiple bullets with similar but distinguishable compositions could have come from the same ""source"". The authors therefore feel that there is no scientific validity to any conclusions more positive than attributing the possible association as to molten source among bullets from different samples. An understanding of the metallurgical principles operative in the melting/casting process as well as the data acquired for this study, indicate that any forensic conclusions which associate unknown bullets with the ""same source"", and/or ""same box"" should fail most or all Daubert criteria.

A set of data from 1837 samples was selected for this study from a sampling of 23,054 lead bullets and shot pellets received as evidence in the FBI Laboratory over the period 1989 through 2002. The method used for selection of samples from case submissions ensured that no two samples of the same general type from the same case were included and that no bias was introduced concerning representation of manufacturers or production sources. A total of 1,686,366 pairwise lead sample comparisons were made using the concentrations of the elements Sb, Cu, As, Ag, Bi, Sn, and Cd using a match criterion of two times the sum of the standard deviations of the paired samples. Of the 1837 samples, 1397 samples, or 76%, are distinguishable from every other sample in this study. The total number of indistinguishable sample pairs is 674, for a frequency of 1 out of every 2502 comparisons. The frequency of occurrence of matching samples decreases as the number of measured elements is increased and as the precision of the measurements improves. For bullets in which all seven elements were determined, the match frequency is 1 in 7284. Compositional comparison of bullet lead provides a reliable, highly significant point of evidentiary comparison of potential sources of crime-related bullets.

Here we characterize the GSR elements present in the Brazilian lead-free ammunition produced by Companhia Brasileira de Cartuchos (CBC) and commercialized by MagTech in the U.S. and Europe under the name CleanRangeÂ® centerfire cartridges. Both first and second generations of CleanRangeÂ® in calibers 9 mm Luger, .40 S&amp;W, .380 AUTO and .38 SPL were analyzed and compared to regular Brazilian CBC ammunition by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy. Differences in composition and morphology of GSR particles from the two generations of CleanRangeÂ® were observed. The first generation ammunition (found in Europe) presented spherical particles, being strontium the only unique element detected. The second generation (found in the U.S.) produced irregular particles composed mostly by potassium, aluminum, silicon and calcium. We can conclude that identification of GSR derived from CBC second generation lead-free ammunition in suspects' hands may be impossible without the addition of a distinct metallic taggant in the primer composition by the manufacturer.

The source of these particles was determined to be percussion primers used to initiate the chemical reaction for deployment. This article identifies some vehicles which contain this type of airbag and demonstrates the types of particles which could be misidentified as being GSR. The low numbers of GSR particles in among the large particle populations of zirconium and/or copper-cobalt particles, which are clearly airbag residue, allow the trained analysts to distinguish the correct source of this residue. Particles containing high aluminum levels, elevated levels of allowable elements in GSR particles, or the presence of elements that are rare in GSR particles stand out as indications that the particles are not GSR in origin.

Although analytical approaches (e.g. automated Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDS) microanalysis) allow the determination of the presence of elements typically found in gunshot residue (GSR) particles, such analyses provide no information about a given particle's actual source. Possible origins for which scientists may need to account for are a primary exposure to the discharge of a firearm or a secondary transfer due to a contaminated environment. In order to approach such sources of uncertainty in the context of evidential assessment, this paper studies the construction and practical implementation of graphical probability models (i.e. Bayesian networks). These can assist forensic scientists in making the issue tractable within a probabilistic perspective.

Choosing two Poisson distributions, the parameter Î» of the first one coincides with the mean number of GSRs that can be found on a firearm shooter, while the parameter Î¼ of the second one is the mean number of GSRs that can be found on a nonshooter.

Three types of popular Luger 9 mm ammunition were chosen with primer mixtures based on different types of detonators: mercury fulminate, lead styphnate or lead azide and an organic one, e.g. diazodinitrophenol. Two modifications of lead-free ammunition, with copper and tin plated projectiles were used. Samples of GSR were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry. Both, similarities and differences in the chemical composition and morphology of GSR secured from the hands of the shooting person and from the appropriate cartridge case were observed. The chemical composition of the characteristic gunshot particles originating from the primer may be influenced by the chemical composition of other parts of the cartridge case, especially the core and the jacket of the projectile. Thus, the distribution of the chemical elements in GSR strongly depends on the direction of the reaction path starting in the primer cup placed at the bottom of the cartridge case, moving along the cartridge case and finishing when the projectile leaves the gun muzzle.

GSR samples were obtained using Walther P-99 pistol and Luger 9 mm ammunition of Polish production. The experiments were designed in such a manner that the substrates for collecting GSR reminded the ones usually obtained for examinations within criminal cases. Results of the performed examinations in the form of parameters describing GSR particles: the number of GSR, proportions of their chemical classes as well as their sizes revealed a dependence on the shooting distance both, in the direction of shooting and backwards, i.e. on the shooting person. The analysis of the distribution of particles in the vicinity of the shooting gun may be utilised in description of the general rules of the dispersion of GSR as well as in the reconstruction of a real shooting case.

In this study, GSR samples taken from seven different locations around and in the firearm were collected and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Four different types of ammunition were applied. Very low correlations were found when different ammunition were used. This clearly shows that it is possible to differentiate between ammunition types. When the same ammunition was used, high correlations were found between samples taken from external positions (such as hands of shooter, bullet-entrance holes) but poor correlation was found between internal samples (such as firearm barrel, cartridge case) and external samples. A high degree of association was found between samples that simulated victim and shooter. These findings clearly demonstrate that GSR comparison studies are meaningful but care needs to be taken when choosing suitable exhibits. External samples (such as hands of shooter, bullet-entrance holes) are more suitable candidates than internal samples (barrel of the firearm, cartridge case).

The participating laboratories were requested to determine the total number of PbSbBa containing particles on a synthetic test sample following their own laboratory specific methods of automated GSR particle search and detection by SEM/EDX. Furthermore size and position of the detected particles had to be reported by the laboratories and were evaluated statistically. The results were compiled by means of z-scores according to the IUPAC and EURACHEM guidelines - assessing individual laboratory achievements (inter-laboratory) as well as intra-laboratory performance - and were compared to the results of the previous proficiency test run GSR2003 (1).

In the present study, the transfer of textile fibres from the entrance and exit regions into the bullet path was systematically investigated with the help of a skin-gelatine composite model. For this purpose, the skin of the bullet entrance and exit region was covered with textile fabric (jeans or jersey material), before conducting four test series of ten test shots each firing a 9-mm Parabellum full-jacketed projectile from a distance of 2 m. The length of the bullet track was 25 and 8 cm, respectively. Subsequently, the bullet tracks were microscopically investigated in sections for the presence of textile fibres. In all the investigated bullet tracks, textile fibres both from the entrance and exit regions could be demonstrated.

Small areas from positive 'lifts' for copper residues via the DTO test and lead residues via the sodium rhodizonate test were excised and examined by SEM-EDS. This not only allowed for a confirmation of copper and lead in these 'lifts' but also permitted the detection and identification of other metals associated with the construction and/ or design of the bullet producing each impact site. This enhanced information included the detection of various levels of zinc alloyed with gilding metal and brass bullet jackets as well as the constituents of alternate bullet jacket compositions such as copper-plated steel jackets, aluminum jackets, and nickel-plated jackets. Trace amounts of copper from Lubaloyplated lead bullets could also be detected by SEM-EDS examination of positive sodium rhodizonate 'lifts' of a ricochet impact site produced by a copper-plated Winchester .38 Special Lubaloy bullet. Both tungsten and copper could easily be identified in a ricochet mark produced by a 9mm frangible bullet composed of these two metals in a plastic matrix.

Lead Check swabs were developed to be a quick, safe, and easy way to detect lead on painted surfaces. Such swabs could be useful as a presumptive test for lead at crime scenes. The effectiveness of the two testing techniques on different media was compared after test firing bullets into different media (plywood, cotton clothing, denim, drywall and automobile body metal) at a distance of 1 yard. The specificity for lead of the swabs was comparedagainst different metals (copper, zinc, barium, etc.). The swabs performed equally well on all the test media used. It was also determined that although the swabs by themselves were not specific for lead, an additional treatment of the surface with a 5% solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) allowed the swabs to be used to distinguish between lead and elements similar to lead (barium, thallium and cadmium). The conclusion was reached that the Lead Check swabs can be a useful presumptive test for lead in forensic identification and crime scene work.","Gunshot Residues, Lead Check Swabs, Sodium Rhodizonate Test",Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2010,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

The samples were examined under a light microscope, in transmitted bright field illumination and phase contrast mode, and with confocal laser scanning microscopy. In all skin specimens the area of each histological section was directly measured by an image analysis system. Both the number and the size of powder particles were measured. The distribution of gunshot residues (GSR) in the epidermal and subepidermal layers was also analyzed. The evaluation of the microscopic entrance wounds demonstrated different findings related to the range of fire. The data derived from the evaluation of both macroscopic and microscopic features demonstrated that the amount and the spatial distribution of GSR deposits in the skin surrounding entrance wounds strictly correlate with shooting distance.

The modified Griess test is used to document this distribution. In the absence of such patterns, the modified Griess test would reveal the presence of submicroscopic nitrite particles. However, such particles would not form a pattern for the examiner to estimate the shooting distance. With the advent of digital photography, access to photographic paper for use in the modified Griess test transfer method may be limited. Blotter paper was found to be a suitable alternate transfer medium for this test. Inorganic nitrites exposed to water were found to be lost due to their solubility. One must be mindful of the weathering factors when applying the modified Griess test to estimate the muzzle to target distance. When both the modified Griess test and the sodium rhodizonate test are used in shooting range estimation, one must also be careful that the application of heat in the modified Griess may cause the loss of volatile lead, leading to an erroneous conclusion.","loss of nitrites, modified Griess test, microscopic examination, weathering",,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2010,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

The study was focused on the scenario in which the contamination might be caused by the surface on which the shot victim could fall. Contamination of two types of textile was examined after contact with two types of surfaces. One round was fired above those surfaces (the line of firing parallel to the surface) prior to the contact. It was found that few gunpowder residue particles could be transferred to the clothing. These findings should be taken into account when interpreting results for shooting distance estimation in cases when a minute quantity of gunpowder residue particles is found around the bullet entrance hole.

In recent years, however, owing to the modernization of police arms and their availability on the legal and illicit markets, pistols have become increasingly popular and currently represent about 20% of police seizures. In a previous paper we presented a novel collection method for gunshot residues (GSR) using a sampling procedure based on ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution as a complexing agent on moistened swabs with subsequent detection using sector field-high resolution-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SF-HR-ICP-MS). In the present paper, we discuss the capability of this methodology to identify antimony (Sb), barium (Ba) and lead (Pb) on the hands of volunteers after shot tests with 9 mm and 0.40 in. caliber pistols. Two types of munitions were tested: 9 mm Taurus and clean range. The use of a technique with high sensitivity, such as SF-HR-ICP-MS, permits the identification of low concentrations (less than 1 Î¼g/L) of metals in firearm residue and constitutes a powerful tool in forensic science. We also discuss the importance of the sampling procedure, including collection from a different body part than the gun hand of the suspect. Comparison of the analytical data obtained allows clear discrimination between samples from the hands of shooters and non-shooters. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The potential of small calibre munitions was barely studied in the past and this work did therefore focus on that problematic. The first step was to optimise the detection potential of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometry detector (GC/MS). This allowed determining the organic volatile composition of empty cartridges immediately after a gunshot. Identification of 32 detected compounds was confirmed by the analysis of reference substances. Preliminary aging studies over 32 h were carried out on selected target compounds to evaluate their potential to determine the time since discharge of empty cartridge cases.

This paper reports the extraction of odor signature compounds characteristic of smokeless powders, followed by their detection by ion mobility spectrometers (IMS). Such a method enables the detection of odor compounds, complementing canine detection and allows for mass calibration of IMS instruments. The smokeless powder additives reported include diphenylamine (DPA), ethyl centralite, 2-ethyl 1-hexanol and 2,4-dinitrotoluene. The pre-concentration of these volatile odor chemicals from different commercial smokeless powders onto a solid phase microextraction (SPME) device followed by IMS analysis is demonstrated in this paper. Five samples of smokeless powder samples representing double-based and single-based powders from three popular commercial brands were chosen for this study. Diphenylamine was found to be a common additive among all the powders tested. The mass of the analytes in the headspace available for detection was determined from response curves of the corresponding standards. The response curves were generated by printing precise amounts of standards onto substrates and analyzing them. The absolute detection limits were also determined from these response curves and the values ranged from 0.12 to 1.2 ng for the standards. Typical extraction times ranged between 5 and 40 min and the mass of diphenylamine and ethyl centralite extracted at the lowest extraction times was found to be greater than the LOD of the compounds.

Gunshot residue from the cartridges was deposited on cotton cloth and collision-induced dissociation MS/MS was used to identify low levels of ethyl centralite in the residue, despite the presence of contaminants.

This method uses desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)-tandem mass spectrometry and directly desorbs and detects analytes from surfaces without any sampling process. Typical transitions for MC and EC, m/z 241 to m/z 134 and m/z 269 to m/z 148, respectively, were used to improve the assay sensitivity. It has been shown that MC and EC can be detected on various surfaces, with detection limits of 5-70 pg/cm2. Interferences, detection time after shooting and the number of times hands were washed after shooting were also evaluated. None of the materials interfered with the results and the detection window for organic GSRs was up to 12 h and hands could be washed at least six times. Further samples were analyzed to confirm the reliability of this method, and showed that it could discriminate shooters from nonshooters. This method should be of significance in forensic science, especially in analyzing GSRs, because of its simplicity, high throughput, and the direct detection of MC and EC on suspects' hands, clothes, and hair.

Aspects of both inorganic and organic GSR are discussed, from formation and distribution, to sample collection, preparation, and analysis using a variety of techniques. The interpretation of GSR results is also considered including issues surrounding the contamination, distribution, and transfer of GSR. Potential problems with ulterior sources of GSR like particles have been reported in the literature. For example, particles from environmental and occupational sources have been highlighted as exhibiting similar chemical and morphological characteristics to GSR. These findings are put into context with regard to interpreting samples. A move toward a ""case by case"" approach is argued to be more preferable to a ""formal"" classification system where possible. The analysis of both inorganic and organic compositions of residue samples as well as morphological considerations is considered to be a more ideal approach to GSR analysis, whereever practicable.

Firework residue was collected at a display site, from amongst spectators as well as from the author's hair 90. min after the display. SEM-EDX analysis has detected such particulate in all three scenarios, with the firework particle population at large providing a solid ground for discrimination from GSR. Wind dispersal was found to decrease the particle population and subsequently, the latter's discriminatory power. Some particles, if treated individually were found to be indistinguishable from GSR. Findings also include residues which may mimic strontium based GSR as well as GSR which may be mixed with that from previous firings. The continuous changes made to primer and propellant compositions by manufacturers also call for greater consideration when classifying particles as originating from pyrotechnic devices. Furthermore, authorities such as police forces should be made more aware about the incidence of such particle transfer in firework related periods.

In the first part of the study, 17 different types of rimfire powder loads were discharged and their residues analyzed by scanning electron microscopyâ€”energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDX). The residues from each of the powder loads consisted of lead/barium, lead, and barium particles. Two brands of fasteners were used in testing in the second part of the study. Both types of fasteners were made of steel and coated in zinc. Twelve trials were conducted, driving 10 fasteners each. Samples were collected from the hands of the powder-actuated tool operator at the end of each trial and analyzed by SEM/EDX. The residues on the tool operators' hands consisted of particles of lead/barium, lead, barium, and zinc. No significant incorporation of zinc into the lead/barium particles was observed. No characteristic lead/barium/antimony particles were observed. Some rimfire ammunition does not contain antimony in its formulation and the lead/barium residues from ammunition of this type cannot be distinguished from powder-actuated tool residue.

In this process, GSR-particles are detected on pertinent objects, often the hands of a suspect, with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis in a scanning electron microscope. The question asked in court is usually the following: "" ... has or has not a given shot been fired by the suspect (at a certain place and time)?"" Unfortunately, this question frequently cannot be answered by the analyst. Only the presence or absence of "" characteristic"" GSR-particles on the investigated sample can be stated with confidence. All other assumptions are inherently biased by many factors that are usually only known by the culprit or are generally unknown. In order to draw more profound conclusions from GSR analytical results, the dynamics of GSR particles have to be considered, i.e., how these particles reach a suspect. Consequently, the formation of the plume after firing was investigated for eleven different firearms with high speed-video analysis. The results show that a vast scope exists between revolvers - distributing many particles near the shooter - and e.g. shotguns that are quite sealed. These differences between the various weapon types should be considered for interpretation of the results of GSR-analysis.

Possible origins for which scientists may need to account for are a primary exposure to the discharge of a firearm or a secondary transfer due to a contaminated environment. In order to approach such sources of uncertainty in the context of evidential assessment, this paper studies the construction and practical implementation of graphical probability models (i.e. Bayesian networks).

The analysis of volatile gunshot residue remaining after shooting using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography (GC) was proposed to meet this objective. However, current interpretative models suffer from several conceptual drawbacks which render them inadequate to assess the evidential value of a given measurement. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a logical approach based on the assessment of likelihood ratios. A probabilistic model was thus developed and applied to a hypothetical scenario where alternative hypotheses about the discharge time of a spent cartridge found on a crime scene were forwarded. In order to estimate the parameters required to implement this solution, a non-linear regression model was proposed and applied to real published data. The proposed approach proved to be a valuable method for interpreting aging-related data.

Samples of the residue were collected from targets placed at various distances in the range 0-100. cm as well as from hands and clothing of the shooting person. Targets were covered by fragments of white cotton fabric or black bovine leather. In the case of cotton targets microtraces were collected from circles of 5 and 10. cm in radius. Results of the examinations in the form of numbers of particles, proportions of their chemical classes and dimensions revealed a dependence on the distance from the gun muzzle, both in the direction of shooting and in the opposite one, i.e., on the shooting person. The parameters describing gunshot residue differed also depending on the kind of the target substrate. The kind of obtained information gives rise to understanding the general rules of the dispersion of gunshot residue in the surroundings of the shooting gun. Thus, it may be utilised in the reconstruction of shooting incidences, especially in establishing the mutual positions of the shooter and other participants of the incident.

This study measured the relative amount of GSR detected on the shooter and on three bystanders in close proximity. Test-firings were conducted in duplicate using five different handguns with ammunition containing conventional lead, barium, and antimony based primers. Samples were collected from the right hand of the shooter 15 minutes after discharge. Bystanders were sampled 15 minutes after discharge and 2 hours after the initial sampling. A scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray detector was used to analyze the samples. A high variability of GSR deposition was observed between firearm/ammunition combinations and between replicate firings. In some instances bystanders had similar concentrations of GSR on their hands to the shooter, making it impossible to distinguish between the two on the basis of particle numbers. Furthermore, after an additional 2 hours, most of the bystanders who initially had GSR particles on their hands had lost them through routine activity. The loss was comparable to what was expected from the hands of shooters based on information published in the literature.

Sample collection devices were positioned at the firearm's ejection port and horizontally positioned down range up to a distance of 18 m. The collection devices were analyzed for gunshot residue (GSR) using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDX). The area of highest GSR particle deposition was observed to be 13.5 m downrange of the firearm, however small numbers of particles were also found at a distance of 18 m. A target cube at a distance of 18 m was used to separate GSR particles travelling on the bullet from those travelling diffusely in the broad plume of gases emitted from the firearm. It was found that GSR particles travel in close association with the projectile as it was observed that the concentration of GSR particles on the rear target was an order of magnitude higher than the concentration on the forward target. GSR particle numbers cannot be used to distinguish between a shooter, an individual near the path of the projectile, or a shooting victim.

The potential for these vehicles and facilities being sources of secondary GSR contamination needed to be determined. A total of 201 samples were collected from randomly selected vehicles and detention facilities. The sampling collected trace materials from surfaces that suspects' hands may contact during the arrest process. These samples were examined for the presence of GSR particles using scanning electron microscopy. Upon completion of the automated analysis, those particles that met an initial GSR screening criterion were relocated and reanalyzed. The locations where GSR particles were recovered allowed us to make recommendations to the Chicago Police Department with regard to transporting and detaining these suspects.

Since the presence of a few particles can in some cases already have a strong indicative value, the GSR experts have to evaluate in their daily work the risk of a potential contamination of these suspects during their arrest. A few studies conducted on police officers and police facilities concluded that the risk of secondary transfer on arrested suspects is quite negligible. However, the case of special force units of the police should be taken into account, since these units can be assumed to be highly contaminated by GSR due to their intensive training.The aim of this study is to evaluate this possibility of particle transfer by performing simulations of arrests by special force police units, according to both low and high contamination scenarios. The results show that secondary transfers of GSR during these simulations are in most cases not negligible, even for the low contamination scenario. This is especially apparent on the vests of the target persons, with an average of 7 GSR particles (2 PbBaSb and 5 TiZn) found on the stubs used on these materials. Of course, the major contamination levels were observed in the case of the high contamination scenario, due to the use of highly contaminated gloves by the police officers during the arrests. Some recommendations are proposed to take into account this risk of contamination and to try to minimize it, or at least to better identify it.

The firearm discharge process is analogous to a complex chemical reaction. The reagents of this process are represented by the chemical composition of the ammunition, firearm, and cartridge case. The specific firearm parameters determine the conditions of the reaction and thus the subsequent product, GSR. We found that Raman spectra collected from these products are characteristic for different caliber ammunition. GSR particles from 9 mm and 0.38 caliber ammunition, collected under identical discharge conditions, were used to demonstrate the capability of confocal Raman microspectroscopy for the discrimination and identification of GSR particles. The caliber differentiation algorithm is based on support vector machines (SVM) and partial least squares (PLS) discriminant analyses, validated by a leave-one-out cross-validation method. This study demonstrates for the first time that NIR Raman microspectroscopy has the potential for the reagentless differentiation of GSR based upon forensically relevant parameters, such as caliber size. When fully developed, this method should have a significant impact on the efficiency of crime scene investigations.

To date, the great majority of the analyses have focused on the inorganic components of GSR, but the introduction of ""lead-free"" or ""nontoxic"" ammunitions makes it difficult to prevent false negatives. This study introduces a fast methodology for the organic analysis of GSR using Raman spectroscopy. Six different types of ammunition were fired at short distances into cloth targets, and the Raman spectra produced by the GSR were measured and compared with the spectra from the unfired gunpowder ammunition. The GSR spectrum shows high similarity to the spectrum of the unfired ammunition, allowing the GSR to be traced to the ammunition used. Additionally, other substances that might be found on the victim's, shooter's, or suspect's clothes and might be confused with GSR, such as sand, dried blood, or black ink from a common ballpoint pen, were analyzed to test the screening capability of the Raman technique. The results obtained evidenced that Raman spectroscopy is a useful screening tool when fast analysis is desired and that little sample preparation is required for the analysis of GSR evidence.

Tape lifts were used to collect inorganic residues from skin surfaces. The laser ablation pattern and ICPMS conditions were optimized for the detection of metals present in GSR, such as 121Sb, 137Ba, and 208Pb. Other isotopes ( 27Al, 29Si, 31P, 33S, 35Cl, 39K, 44Ca, 57Fe, 60Ni, 63Cu, 66Zn, and 118Sn) were monitored during the ICPMS analyses to obtain additional information to possibly classify the GSR particles as either characteristic of GSR or consistent with GSR. In experiments with real samples, different firearms, calibers, and ammunitions were used. The performed method evaluation confirms that the developed methodology can be used as an alternative to the standard scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) technique, with the significant advantage of drastically reducing the analysis time to less than 66 min.

If organic gunshot residues (OGSR) were found in combination with inorganic particles, the possibility of environmental sources could be potentially eliminated, thereby significantly enhancing the strength of the evidence.Methods have been previously described whereby GSR specimens can be analysed for the presence of OGSR or inorganic GRS (IGSR). However, no methods have been reported that allow the analysis of both OGSR and IGSR on the same specimen.Described in this article is a direct method using desorption electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) for the detection of methyl centralite (MC), ethyl centralite (EC) and diphenylamine (DPA) on adhesive tape GSR stubs typically used for scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis. The optimisation of numerous parameters was conducted using an experimental design. The results indicate that direct analysis of these organic components of GSR is possible although some limitations were also identified.This initial investigation has also indicated that subjecting stubs to DESI analysis does not interfere with subsequent SEM-EDX analysis of primer residues; therefore the technique described herein allows a comprehensive examination of GSR that would be highly probative in the event that both OGSR and IGSR are detected in the same specimen.

These residues, consisting of particulates such as burned and unburned powder as well as molecular compounds, are rarely used in casework except for purposes such as shooting reconstructions. Molecular compounds that survive the firing event or that are created as a result of the firing event could, with focused research and development, open a new avenue for forensic gunshot residue analysis. In this study, the persistence of organic gunshot residue was evaluated using diphenylamine (DPA) as a target analyte and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) as the detection system. Samples were collected from hands using a solvent swabbing technique and the swab was analyzed using direct thermal desorption for sample introduction into the IMS. OGSR was found to persist for at least 4. h. Although DPA is a widely used industrial compound, analysis of numerous blank and background samples (n~ 100) did not show any significant response for DPA using this detector. Variations were noted among individuals and as such, the data set does not support estimation of a half-life as has been done for traditional primer residues. No secondary transfers were observed, suggesting the possibility of skin adhesion via interactions between the lipophilic organic compounds and skin lipids. IMS proved valuable as a means of generating patterns for forensic pattern matching and shows promise as a screening tool applied to firearms discharge.

The method usually provides good results but has its drawbacks when it comes to the examination of ammunition containing lead-free primers or bloody clothing. A milli-X-ray fluorescence (m-XRF) spectrometer with a large motorized stage can help to circumvent these problems allowing the acquisition of XRF mappings of relatively large areas (up to 20 x 20 cm) in millimeter resolution within reasonable time (2-10 hours) for almost all elements. First experiences in GSR casework at the Forensic Science Institute of the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) have shown, that m-XRF is a useful supplementation for conventional methods in shooting ranges estimation, which helps if there are problems in transferring a GSR pattern to secondary targets (e.g. bloody or stained garments) or if there is no suitable color test available for the element of interest. The resulting elemental distributions are a good estimate for the shooting range and can be evaluated by calculating radial distributions or integrated count rates of irregular shaped regions like pieces of human skin which are too small to be investigated with a conventional WD-XRF spectrometer. Beside a mapping mode the milli-XRF offers also point and line scan modes which can also be utilized in gunshot crime investigations as a quick survey tool to identify bullet holes based on the elements present in the wipe ring.

As it is possible to take the mappings of all relevant elements into account, the shooting range estimation becomes more reliable.

From the nature of the samples, i.e. a small amount of GSR deposited on a highly scattering background some problems arise.

In the present study intermediate-range gunshot wounds have been analysed by means of a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) coupled to an image analysis software in order to quantify the powder particles and to determine the firing distance. A total of 50 shootings were performed on skin sections obtained from human legs surgically amputated for medical reasons. For each tested distance (5, 15, 23, 30 and 40 cm), firing was carried out perpendicularly at the samples using a 7.65- mm pistol loaded with jacketed bullets. Uninjured skin sections were used as controls. By increasing the firing distance, micro-CT analysis demonstrated a clear decreasing trend in the mean GSR percentage, particularly for shots fired from more than 15 cm. For distances under 23 cm, the powder particles were concentrated on the epidermis and dermis around the hole, and inside the cavity; while, at greater distances, they were deposited only on the skin surface. Statistical analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between the amount of GSR deposits and the firing range, well explained by a Gaussian-like function. The proposed method allowed a good discrimination for all the tested distances, proving to be an objective, rapid and inexpensive tool for estimating the firing range in intermediate-range gunshot wounds.

Our aim is to address the key challenge of minimizing the false positive identification of individuals suspected of discharging a firearm. The chemometric treatment of voltammetric data from different controls using Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) provides several distinct clusters for each scenario examined. Multiple samples were taken from subjects in controlled tests such as secondary contact with gunshot residue (GSR), loading a firearm, and postdischarge of a firearm. These controls were examined at both bare carbon and gold-modified screen-printed electrodes using different sampling methods: the 'swipe' method with integrated sampling and electroanalysis and a more traditional acid-assisted q-tip swabbing method. The electroanalytical fingerprint of each sample was examined using square-wave voltammetry; the resulting data were preprocessed with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), followed by CVA treatment. High levels of discrimination were thus achieved in each case over 3 classes of samples (reflecting different levels of involvement), achieving maximum accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of 100% employing the leave-one-out validation method. Further validation with the 'jack-knife' technique was performed, and the resulting values were in good agreement with the former method. Additionally, samples from subjects in daily contact with relevant metallic constituents were analyzed to assess possible false positives. This system may serve as a potential method for a portable, field-deployable system aimed at rapidly identifying a subject who has loaded or discharged a firearm to verify involvement in a crime, hence providing law enforcement personnel with an invaluable forensic tool in the field.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and cyclic square-wave stripping voltammetry (C-SWV) are shown to detect, in a single run, common propellants, such as nitroglycerin (NG) and dinitrotoluene (DNT), along with the heavy metal constituents of GSR, antimony (Sb), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and barium (Ba). The voltammetric detection of the stabilizer diphenylamine (DPA) along with inorganic constituents has also been examined. The resulting electrochemical signatures combine - in a single voltammogram - the response for the various metals and organic species, based on the reduction and oxidation peaks of the constituents. Cyclic square-wave voltammetry at the glassy carbon electrode (GCE), involving an intermittent accumulation at the reversal potentials of -0.95 V (for Sb, Pb, DNT and NG) and -1.3 V (for Sb, Pb, Zn and DPA) is particularly useful to offer distinct electrochemical signatures for these constituents of GSR mixtures, compared to analogous cyclic voltammetric measurements. Simultaneous voltammetric measurements of barium (at thin-film Hg GCE) and DNT (at bare GCE) are also demonstrated in connection to intermittent accumulation at the reversal potential of -2.4 V. Such generation of unique, single-run, information-rich inorganic/organic electrochemical fingerprints holds considerable promise for 'on-the-spot' field identification of individuals firing a weapon, as desired for diverse forensic investigations.

Relatively little work has been reported on the post-discharge GSR content of non-metallic inorganic or low molecular weight organic anions to distinguish between different ammunition types. The development of an analytical method using suppressed micro-bore anion exchange chromatography (IC) is presented for the analysis of GSR. A hydroxide gradient was optimised for the separation of 19 forensically relevant organic and inorganic anions in <23. min and sensitivities of the order of 0.12-3.52. ng of anion detected for all species were achieved. Along with an optimised extraction procedure, this method was applied to the analysis of post-ignition residues from three selected ammunition types. By profiling and comparing the anionic content in each ammunition residue, the possibility to distinguish between each type using their anionic profiles and absolute weight is presented. The potential for interference is also discussed with respect to sample types which are typically problematic in the analysis of GSR using SEM-EDX and GC-MS. To the best of our knowledge this represents the first study on the analysis of inorganic anions in GSR using suppressed ion chromatography.

Currently, scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) is the standard technique adopted for the analysis and identification of GSR; however, this methodology is inefficient for lead-free ammunition. Herein, we report the inclusion of high photoluminescent metal-organic frameworks in ammunition to allow for the visual detection of GSR. The tests indicated that marked GSR is easily visible in proportions above 5.0 wt %. A total of 1 g of marker suffices to tag 100 0.38 mm bullets or 62 0.40 mm bullets.

Lead (Pb), barium (Ba) and antimony (Sb) concentrations in GSR from .38 caliber TaurusÂ® handguns were monitored, and three important methodologies were evaluated such as: i) the collection region of the hand of the shooter; ii) tape-type versus swab collectors; and iii) GSR quantification from the right and left hands. Pb, Ba and Sb were found in four of the hand regions analyzed (palm, back, thumb and forefinger palm (TF-palm), and thumb and forefinger back (TF-back)), with their concentrations increasing as a function of the number of shots (one, three and five). Lead was found to be the most abundant species present. In terms of relative analytical sensitivity, higher concentrations of these three elements are mainly found in the back, TF-palm and TF-back regions. The effect of hand washing was also evaluated, which the TF-palm and the TF-back regions maintained sensitivity for the detection of three elements (concentrations higher than 4.56Î¼gL-1) for only three and five shots. Among the collection devices analyzed, swab collectors (dry, moistened with EDTA, and moistened with water) presented higher sensitivity than tape-type collectors (adhesive, double-sided and adhesive-plaster). Additionally, swabs are a more economical collection device, providing a simple and fast collection method that does not require microwave digestion. Pb, Ba and Sb concentrations were also evaluated on the left and right hands. It was observed that Pb is mainly found on the right hand, whereas Ba and Sb concentrations are similar on both hands. ICP OES is therefore a powerful tool for GSR analysis, providing multielemental quantification of Pb, Ba and Sb.

Lead (Pb), barium (Ba) and antimony (Sb) concentrations in GSR from .38 revolver and .380 and .40 caliber pistols were determined as function of number of shots (from 1 to 5 for the .38 revolver and from 1 to 10 for the pistols) and multiple linear regression model was constructed to determine the number of shots. Also, the sensitivity of ICP OES was compared to conventional colorimetric test in function of distance of shooting (from 0 to 200cm). Analyzing the effect of distance of shooting over the GSR concentration, the colorimetric test evidenced the presence of a red-pink color only at short distances (from 0 to 10cm), thus indicating the presence of Pb. For ICP OES analyses, the two analytical methodologies employed presented higher sensitivity than the colorimetric assay, where Pb, Ba and Sb are found from 0cm ([Pb]=3158.63Î¼gL-1; [Ba]=85.33Î¼gL-1; and [Sb]=104.90Î¼gL-1) to 200cm ([Pb]=81.52Î¼gL-1; [Ba]=20.20Î¼gL-1; and [Sb]=8.32Î¼gL-1) for the extraction using digestion by microwave. For analyses of GSR using different firearms, good linear correlation coefficients (R2&gt;0.97) were observed between the GSR concentration and the number of shots. Therefore, it was possible to predict the number of shots with good accuracy from Pb, Ba and Sb concentrations using .38 revolver and .40 and .380 caliber pistols. Furthermore, the GSR concentration from different firearms, increased in the following order: .40 pistol&gt;.380 pistol&gt;38 revolver.

These particles are commonly referred to as gunshot residues (GSR). The aim of this work is to compare the elemental ratios of the GSR with those found in the primer of pristine cartridges in order to check for possible correlations. To that end, the elemental concentration of gunshot residues and the respective ammunition were investigated through PIXE (Particle-Induced X-ray Emission) and micro-PIXE techniques. The ammunition consisted of a.38 SPL caliber (ogival lead type) charged in a Taurus revolver. Pristine cartridges were taken apart for the PIXE measurements. The shooting sessions were carried out in a restricted area at the Forensic Institute at Porto Alegre. Residues ejected at forward directions were collected on a microporous tape. The PIXE experiments were carried out employing 2.0 MeV proton beams with a beam spot size of 1 mm2. For the micro-PIXE experiments, the samples were irradiated with 2.2 MeV proton beams of 2 a— 2 Î¼m2. The results found for the ratios of Sb/Pb, Ba/Pb and Sb/Ba do not correlate with those stemming from the analysis of the primer. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, GSR samples taken from seven different locations around and in the firearm were collected and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Four different types of ammunition were applied. Very low correlations were found when different ammunition were used. This clearly shows that it is possible to differentiate between ammunition types. When the same ammunition was used, high correlations were found between samples taken from external positions (such as hands of shooter, bullet-entrance holes) but poor correlation was found between internal samples (such as firearm barrel, cartridge case) and external samples. A high degree of association was found between samples that simulated victim and shooter. These findings clearly demonstrate that GSR comparison studies are meaningful but care needs to be taken when choosing suitable exhibits. External samples (such as hands of shooter, bullet-entrance holes) are more suitable candidates than internal samples (barrel of the firearm, cartridge case).

GSR particles are composed of spherical particles of several micrometers of diameter containing distinct amounts of lead, barium and antimony, along with other organic and inorganic elements arising from the primer, gunpowder, the gun and the bullet itself. This study was carried out to obtain additional information on the properties of GSR nanoparticles originated from different types of regular ammunition produced in Brazil by CBC. Besides the SEM, we have used a TEM, exploring its high magnification capability and ability to explore internal structure and chemical composition of submicron particles. We observed that CBC ammunition generated smaller particles than usually reported for other ammunitions and that the three component particles are not a majority. TEM analysis revealed that GSR are partially composed of sub-micron particles as well. The electron diffraction pattern from these particles confirmed them to be mainly composed of lead oxides crystalline nanoparticles that may be agglomerated into larger particles. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed that most of them were composed of two elements, especially PbSb. Ba was not a common element found in the nanoparticles.

With the advent of modern technologies in manufacturing ammunition, which replace toxic compounds of lead, antimony and barium in the primer mixture by elements and compounds such as powdered aluminium, titanium, amorphous boron or calcium silicide, differentiation between gunshot residue and morphologically similar particles originating from other anthropogenic or natural sources becomes more difficult. This work provides a chemical and morphological characterisation of welding fume particles originating from both the core and the covering of electrodes used in popular manners of welding steel and aluminium alloy constructions. With the use of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry it has been established that single spherules containing aluminium, titanium or a set of such elements as aluminium, silicon, potassium and calcium may occur in result of welding processes, however, they are accompanied by great numbers of iron and iron oxide spherules. Thus, with this analytical method a population of welding particles can be distinguished from a population of gunshot residue originating from a modern type of ammunition, but a special care has to be taken when assessing the evidential value of single or few spherules consisting from light elements being detected in result of the search for gunshot residue for forensic purposes.

In this study, we sought to determine the reason for the prevalence of false positive results and to propose a new approach for the analysis of GSR on vehicle seats. GFAAS was used to examine adhesive tape swabs collected from 100 seats of 50 different automobiles. Characterization of seat fabrics was carried out by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) spectroscopy. The results of FTIR analysis indicated that all seat covers containing antimony were composed of polyester. Experimental results obtained by SEM/EDX analysis revealed that the fabrics in these seat covers contained evenly distributed antimony within the structure of polyester fibers. This study shows that the type of seat fabric should be determined by FTIR spectroscopy before elemental GSR analysis. In this way, most of the false positives caused by polyester fibers in GSR analysis can be prevented.

Criminologie, U., Lausanne-Dorigny, Switzerland","A review of the scientific papers published on inorganic gunshot residue (GSR) analysis permits to study how the particle analysis has shown its capability in detection and identification of gunshot residue. The scanning electron microscope can be the most powerful tool for forensic scientists to determine the proximity to a discharging firearm and/or the contact with a surface exposed to GSR. Particle analysis can identify individual gunshot residue particles through both morphological and elemental characteristics. When particles are detected on the collected sample, the analytical results can be interpreted following rules of a formal general interpretative system, to determine whether they come from the explosion of a primer or from other possible sources. The particles on the sample are compared with an abstract idea of ""unique"" GSR particle produced by the sole source of the explosion of a primer. ""Uniqueness"" is not the only problem related to GSR detection and identification for a forensic scientist. With ""not-unique"" particles interpretation of results is extremely important. The evidential strength of ""not-unique"" particles can increase with a more fruitful interpretative framework based on Bayes rule. For the assessment of the value of a GSR in linking a suspect and a crime, it is important to compare two hypothesis: the first can be that of the evidence if the suspect has been shooting in a specific situation, the second that of the evidence if the suspect was not involved in this shooting. This case specific or case-by-case approach is closer to what the court is interested in. The authors consider that a ""case-by-case"" approach should be followed whenever possible. Research of models and data such as those developed in other trace evidence material (fibres, glass, etc.) using a Bayesian approach is suggested in the interpretation of GSR.

Although analytical approaches (e.g. automated Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDS) microanalysis) allow the determination of the presence of elements typically found in gunshot residue (GSR) particles, such analyses provide no information about a given particle's actual source. Possible origins for which scientists may need to account for are a primary exposure to the discharge of a firearm or a secondary transfer due to a contaminated environment. In order to approach such sources of uncertainty in the context of evidential assessment, this paper studies the construction and practical implementation of graphical probability models (i.e. Bayesian networks).

Choosing two Poisson distributions, the parameter Î» of the first one coincides with the mean number of GSRs that can be found on a firearm shooter, while the parameter Î¼ of the second one is the mean number of GSRs that can be found on a nonshooter. In this scenario, the likelihood ratio of the conditional probabilities of finding a number n of GSRs in the two hypotheses can be easily calculated.

The application of this approach to interpreting the finding of gunshot residue on the clothing of a suspect requires knowledge of background levels of GSR on clothing and on the frequency of different residue types in a particular environment. The cuffs of 100 upper outer garments submitted to a forensic laboratory in connection with non-firearms offences were sampled for gunshot residue. No 3-component lead/antimony/barium particles were found on 98 of them. Two 3-component particles were found on one of them and one 3-component particle was found on another. The frequency of occurrence of various particle types regarded as consistent with GSR was also explored. The findings show that, while 3-component particles were somewhat more likely to be encountered by chance on clothing than on hands, they are still relatively uncommon events. To investigate the frequency of occurrence of particular residue types, 100 discharged rounds of ammunition recovered at crime scenes were sampled and the types of residue present were determined. The results show that some residue types are significantly more common than others.

SEM-EDX with automated detection and analysis software was used to investigate the extent of GSR secondary transfer following the discharge of a firearm. A series of experiments, which mimicked real-world scenarios, was set up to explore these under-researched mechanisms. The findings demonstrate that relatively large amounts of GSR can be transferred to an individual immediately after the discharge of the firearm, through contact with the hands of the shooter or handling of the gun. While varying between runs, over 100 particles were transferred via a handshake in one instance, and it was found that even very large particles (60-100+Î¼m) were transferred from the shooter to the second individual via a handshake. The findings have implications for forensic investigations, including highlighting the need to sample from individuals who might have been involved in transfers and underscoring the importance of achieving accurate particle counts using the SEM-EDX method. Most importantly, the findings suggest that the presence of GSR (especially in small quantities) may not always indicate that a person discharged a firearm and that the possibility for misidentification of the shooter exists, as does the potential to distinguish shooters from those who have acquired GSR through secondary transfer. Further experiments employing automated SEM-EDX are suggested, which will add to our understanding of GSR transfer evidence and continue to improve the accuracy of interpretations which are presented in court.

In particular, the need to prevent unwanted transfer during the collection phase is highlighted, and the importance of acknowledging the possibility of secondary and tertiary transfers when reconstructing firearms incidents is also stressed. Experimental studies offer a means of improving our understanding of the dynamics of GSR transfer and deposition, and assisting the forensic reconstruction of firearms incidents.

In specimens taken from hands of 100 people declaring no contact with firearms only one spherical particle containing lead, antimony and barium was found. Numbers of particles found in specimens collected from hands of 50 shooters varied from zero to numbers greater than 100 and were strongly correlated with the time interval between last shooting and collecting specimens. Within the first 4. h after shooting particles are being lost from the shooter's hands, and so transferred from shooters to their environment. Thus, the relatives of five hunters were examined during both the close and open hunting seasons to trace the potential secondary transfer in practice. Using the criterion of low risk of contamination with gunshot residue, i.e. 5. h after last handling a gun, only few specimens were encountered among these collected from hands of firearm users that contained characteristic particles and these occurred in small numbers. Frequent shooters, e.g. shooting instructors or firearm examiners, formed a class for themselves of high risk of contamination with gunshot residue. As a result of continuous monitoring of the laboratory (55 specimens examined so far), where the examinations of gunshot residue are being carried out, it has been proved that the laboratory is free from contamination and so confirmed the usefulness of protocols worked out. The obtained information provided empirical bases to the minimisation of the risk of contamination of the evidence as well as for the evaluation of the analytical findings in the expertise on gunshot incidents.

The results show a strong relationship between sheddability and collection efficiency, since the collection efficiency is about five-fold higher for leather compared with wool.

At the end of 2011, a field emission gun (FEG)-SEM was installed at the authors' laboratory for this type of examination. Following the installation of the FEG-SEM, an extensive process was conducted, in order to determine the optimal operating parameters of this instrument for GSR analysis. Because the nature of synthetic GSR samples (such as the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes GSR2011 proficiency test sample) is significantly different from casework samples, it was decided not to use them for this purpose. Instead, a GSR casework sample, previously analyzed by tungsten-filament SEM as part of the laboratory's routine examinations, was selected. This sample was repeatedly analyzed (more than 200 times), under different operating conditions. The main parameters that were examined for the FEG-SEM were the electron source accelerating voltage, the backscattered electrons image acquisition time, the magnification, the backscattered electrons image resolution, and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry acquisition time. The smallest detected feature was calculated by the software, based on the set image resolution and magnification. For each set of parameters, the detected GSR particles were recorded, in addition to the total number of detected particles and the time taken for the run. It was found that for a given smallest detected feature, the effective search conditions were higher magnification and lower number of pixels per line. The present work includes a detailed description of the optimization process and its results. The process utilized in this work is applicable for other laboratories conducting similar type of GSR analysis as well.

It is simple, fast and inexpensive due to its high sensitivity and versatility, and it can be used to analyse multiple elements. However, its use in forensic chemistry remains underexplored. This study aims to optimise the analysis of gunshot residues (GSRs) by ICP OES using the concentrations of Pb, Ba and Sb released during the firing of ammunition. In this study, experiments were designed using multivariate optimisation to establish the best operating conditions for ICP OES in GSR samples generated from a .38 revolver. Three variables were studied (radio frequency power, nebuliser gas flow and aspiration rate), and the interactions between those variables were investigated using a central composite design to establish the best analysis parameters. The nebuliser gas flow was the most important parameter in the optimization of the signal intensities, and the interactions between the variables were not significant. The optimum values determined for radio frequency power, nebuliser gas flow and aspiration rate were 1300W, 1.2Lmin-1, and 1.0mLmin-1, respectively. After optimisation of the parameters, the performance characteristics of the proposed method were established: linearity, detection and quantification limits, and accuracy (recovery percentage), with and without addition of an internal standard.

In this work a new sample introduction system, the subcritical fluid nebulizer (ScFN) combined with the flame furnace-atomic absorption spectrometry (FF-AAS) was applied for improving the determination of inorganic tin in aqueous solutions. Online preconcentration of tin as Sn-PDC complex was carried out in a HPLC-guard cartridge (5mm length, 2mm diameter) filled with C-18 coated monolithic silica having an absorption capacity of 2.5Î¼g of tin. For preconcentration optimized conditions were achieved at 0.015% (m/v) of APDC and pH5 obtaining a preconcentration factor of 17 using 2.5 mL of sample volume. The elution was done by means of subcritical liquid carbon dioxide and methanol with a flow rate of 1.5 L min-1 which was directly introduced as a dry aerosol into the flame furnace where tin complexes are vaporized and atomized. Applying ScFN-FF-AAS the detection and quantification limits for tin in water were 0.008 mg L-1 and 0.024 mg L-1, respectively, increasing the power of detection in 325 times compared to the conventional detection limits obtained by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The precision at 1 mg L-1 was 1.5% expressed as RSD (N=10). Tin was determined in samples of gunshot residues generated by firing four ammunition brands.

Nowadays, the method of choice for analyzing GSR is scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDX). However, SEM/EDX presents limitations when the GSR identification of ""non-toxic"" ammunition types is performed. To overcome this drawback, Raman spectroscopy has been recently proposed as a complementary technique to SEM/EDX. However, for the time being, it can only be used in a limited number of casework (e.g. examining the macroscopic GSR produced at short distance over victim's clothes) and further research to know when this technique could support SEM-EDX results is required.In the present work, the memory effect of the weapon, which plays an important role to link the GSR found and the ammunition fired, is studied. Twenty shots were fired at close distance (~30cm) at paper targets using the same weapon with two different types of ammunition. The first, third, ninth, and twentieth shots were fired with the first ammunition and the shots among them using the second ammunition. The macroscopic GSR produced by the first ammunition were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. First, the spectra obtained were visually differentiated by taking into account the band at about 1342cm-1. This first approach shown that in the first shot were no GSR particles from the second ammunition, but 1.5-7.5% of analyzed particles corresponded to the second ammunition in the third, ninth, and twentieth shots. Additionally, the same differentiation was then performed by discriminant analysis using the spectral range from 1800 to 800cm-1. Although using this second approach only one GSR was identified as the second ammunition, was remarkable that after the shots with different ammunition the GSR obtained shows greater variability. The results obtained suggest that the memory effect of the weapon has not a significant influence when the organic analysis of macroscopic GSR on targets by Raman spectroscopy is performed.

A well-established technique for GSR recovery (tape lifting) was utilized for GSR particle collection. Uncontaminated samples of the substrate (tape), organic GSR (OGSR), and inorganic GSR (IGSR) particles were characterized to generate three respective Raman spectroscopic training sets. Automated Raman mapping was used to rapidly collect spectra over areas of the tape substrate populated with GSR particles. Raman spectra collected from the maps were classified against the training sets via partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to determine if GSR was present. We report the application of Raman chemical mapping as a proof of concept for the positive detection of GSR particles of varying morphologies. The estimated size of GSR particles, which could be readily detected by this method, is about 3.4 Î¼m. The efficiency of the classification was quantitated with rates of true positives and negatives. Validation studies scrutinizing the practicality of this approach as a viable tool for potential forensics investigations are currently in progress.

Here, we attempt to achieve this goal by analysis of gunshot residue (GSR) through the use of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) combined with statistical analysis. The firearm discharge process is analogous to a complex chemical process. Therefore, the products of this process (GSR) will vary based upon numerous factors, including the specific combination of the firearm and ammunition which was discharged. Differentiation of FT-IR data, collected from GSR particles originating from three different firearm-ammunition combinations (0.38 in., 0.40 in., and 9 mm calibers), was achieved using projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The technique was cross (leave-one-out), both internally and externally, validated. External validation was achieved via assignment (caliber identification) of unknown FT-IR spectra from unknown GSR particles. The results demonstrate great potential for ATR-FT-IR spectroscopic analysis of GSR for forensic purposes.

Changes in ammunition manufacturing are gradually phasing out the heavy metals on which current forensic GSR analysis is based, and the latest Heavy Metal Free (HMF) primers urgently demand new forensic solutions. Proton scanning microbeam Ion Beam Analysis (IBA), in conjunction with the Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS), can be introduced into forensic analysis to solve both new and old problems, with a procedure entirely commensurate with current forensic practice. Six cartridges producing GSR particles known to be interesting in casework by both experience and the literature were selected for this study. A standard procedure to relocate the same particles previously analysed by SEM-EDS, based on both secondary electron (SE) and X-ray imaging was developed and tested. Elemental Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) mapping of the emitted X-rays allowed relocation in a scan of 10Î¼ma—10Î¼m of even a 1Î¼m GSR particle. The comparison between spectra from the same particle obtained by SEM-EDS and IBA-PIXE showed that the latter is much more sensitive at mid-high energies. Results that are very interesting in a forensic context were obtained with particles from a cartridge containing mercury fulminate in the primer. Particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE) maps of a particles from HMF cartridges allowed identification of Boron and Sodium in particles from hands using the 10B(p,Î±1Î³)7Be, 11B(p,p1Î³)11B and 23Na(p,p1Î³)23Na reactions, which is extraordinary in a forensic context. The capability for quantitative analysis of elements within individual particles by IBA was also demonstrated, giving the opportunity to begin a new chapter in the research on GSR particles. The integrated procedure that was developed, which makes use of all the IBA signals, has unprecedented characterisation and discrimination power for GSR samples.

This has also been prompted by the identification of gunshot residue- (GSR-) like particles in environmental and occupational samples. Various techniques have been investigated for their ability to detect OGSR. Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to a chromatographic system is a powerful tool due to its high selectivity and sensitivity. Further, modern MS instruments can detect and identify a number of explosives and additives which may require different ionization techniques. Finally, MS has been applied to the analysis of both OGSR and inorganic gunshot residue (IGSR), although the ""gold standard"" for analysis is scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray microscopy (SEM-EDX). This review presents an overview of the technical attributes of currently available MS and ionization techniques and their reported applications to GSR analysis.

OGSR also prevents false negatives. Toward this aim, a quick and efficient method based on liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF) was developed to detect and identify 18 gunpowder additives in gunshot residues (GSR). The unequivocal identification of target analytes was assured by using MS/MS mode. Swabs were compared with home-modified tape lift supports covered with a PTFE layer to determine the better sampling technique. The modified tape lift provided better extraction recoveries and enabled the analysis of inorganic and organic GSR simultaneously. The developed method was applied to the analysis of GSR from four different lead-free ammunitions. Diphenylamine and its nitrated degradation products and centralites were identified in all samples, providing strong evidence of GSR.

In this study, two fast screening methods were developed and optimized for the detection of organic compounds and inorganic components indicative of GSR presence on the hands of shooters and non-shooters. The proposed methods consist of headspace extraction of volatile organic compounds using a capillary microextraction of volatiles (CMV) device previously reported as a high-efficiency sampler followed by detection by GC-MS. This novel sampling technique has the potential to yield fast results (<. 2. min sampling) and high sensitivity capable of detecting 3. ng of diphenylamine (DPA) and 8. ng of nitroglycerine (NG). Direct analysis of the headspace of over 50 swabs collected from the hands of suspected shooters (and non-shooters) provides information regarding VOCs present on their hands. In addition, a fast laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) screening method for the detection of the inorganic components indicative of the presence of GSR (Sb, Pb and Ba) is described. The sampling method for the inorganics consists of liquid extraction of the target elements from the same cotton swabs (previously analyzed for VOCs) and an additional 30 swab samples followed by spiking 1. Î¼L of the extract solution onto a Teflon disk and then analyzed by LIBS. Advantages of LIBS include fast analysis (~. 12. s per sample) and high selectivity and sensitivity, with expected LODs 0.1-18. ng for each of the target elements after sampling. The analytical performance of the LIBS method is also compared to previously reported methods (inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy). The combination of fast CMV sampling, unambiguous organic compound identification with GC-MS and fast LIBS analysis provides the basis for a new comprehensive screening method for GSR.

This paper describes the development and optimisation of an ultra high performance liquid chromatography method for the analysis of 32 compounds potentially present in OGSR. An artificial neural network was applied to predict the retention times of the target analytes for various gradients for rapid determination of optimum separation conditions. The final separation and analysis time for the 32 target analytes was 27 minutes with limits of detection ranging from 0.03 to 0.21 ng. The method was applied to the analysis of smokeless powder and samples collected from the hands of a shooter following the discharge of a firearm.

Notably, it is found as an active ingredient in double-base smokeless powders, differentiating them from single-base powders, whose main active ingredient is nitrocellulose. It is proposed that the detection of nitroglycerin within various types of ammunition will allow for the differentiation between single and double-base smokeless powders, thus allowing for a method of distinguishing ammunition or bulk powder samples that may be found during the course of a criminal investigation. Presumptive tests are an effective tool in field-testing for forensic science. These tests are used primarily as rapid, sensitive means of elucidating the chemical characteristics of an unknown sample in-situ.

Beyond this, in areas of conflict it would be desirable to have the capability to establish the source country for weaponry and ammunition. Gunshot residue (GSR) analysis is a reasonably well-studied technology area. Recent scientific publications have reported that the residues have a rich composition of both organic and inorganic compounds. For the purposes of identifying the manufacturer or country of origin for the ammunition, the inorganic components of GSR appear to be especially promising since their presence in the propellant and primer formulations are either specific to a given chemical formula, or they represent impurities in the manufacturing process that can be unique to a manufacturer or the source country for the chemicals used for propellants and primers. The Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) technology has already demonstrated considerable capability for elemental fingerprinting, especially for inorganic/metallic components. A number of reports have demonstrated LIBS capability in forensics for matching materials such as inks, fabrics, paper, glass, and paint.

Currently, there are few if any viable presumptive or screening tests amenable to detection of FDR on skin. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is already widely deployed in law enforcement and homeland security for use as a portable/presumptive detector for narcotics and explosives. The goal of this project was to evaluate IMS for use as a screening device to detect OGSR on hand swabs. Two instruments were thoroughly tested and figures of merit, including detection thresholds, were established. Sample stability was also characterized with significant degradation seen when samples were stored at room temperature. Based on the target compounds and media used, the stability studies suggest a holding time limit of days or a few weeks. Results showed that given proper and specialized QA/QC procedures, IMS can be successfully utilized for screening purposes without requiring modification of instrumentation. A well-suited method for daily monitoring was demonstrated through the use of control charts providing a means to track variability in peak intensity over time. Analysis of more than 200 skin swab samples demonstrated that pattern matching data analysis is preferred to peak-based methods when attempting to ascertain if a person recently fired a weapon.

GSR particles remain stable on the sampling pad for a minimum of two months after chemical exposure (long term stability tests are in progress). The presumptive result provided by the XCAT yields immediate actionable intelligence to law enforcement to facilitate their investigation, without compromising the confirmatory test necessary to further support the investigation and legal case.

This article reviews the use of electrochemical devices for GSR detection over the last 35years and highlights recent advances associated with the demands of GSR field detection such as portability, speed, cost and power. Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) has been widely implemented for the detection of the metallic components of GSR at a variety of working electrodes. Efforts toward the detection of the organic components of GSR have also been reported using cyclic- and square-wave voltammetry. The simultaneous detection of both organic and inorganic GSR constituents has recently been examined to increase the overall information content in a single voltammetric scan. As well as this, exploitation of screen-printing fabrication allows replacement of conventional electrochemical cells with easy-to-use sensor strips Sampling methods for electrochemical GSR analysis are also advancing from acid washes or swabs to simpler abrasive methods which integrate sampling and analysis obviating the need for intermediate processing steps. The latest direction of electrochemical detection of GSR involves chemometric treatment to evaluate data allowing for more objective conclusions and increasing the automation of the system. These advances indicate great promise for investigating firearm-related crimes, and bring significant changes to the detection of GSR making electroanalysis a powerful tool for decentralized forensic analysis.

This manuscript presents a simple, all-solid-state, wearable fingertip sensor for the rapid on-site voltammetric screening of GSR and explosive surface residues. To fabricate the new Forensic Fingers, we screen-print a three-electrode setup onto a nitrile finger cot, and coat another finger cot with an ionogel electrolyte layer. The new integrated sampling/detection methodology relies on 'voltammetry of microparticles' (VMP) and involves an initial mechanical transfer of trace amounts of surface-confined analytes directly onto the fingertip-based electrode contingent. Voltammetric measurements of the sample residues are carried out upon bringing the working electrode (printed on the index finger cot) in direct contact with a second finger cot coated with an ionogel electrolyte (worn on the thumb), thus completing the solid-state electrochemical cell. Sampling and screening are performed in less than four minutes and generate distinct voltammetric fingerprints which are specific to both GSR and explosives. The use of the solid, flexible ionogel electrolyte eliminates any liquid handling which can resolve problems associated with leakage, portability and contamination. A detailed study reveals that the fingertip detection system can rapidly identify residues of GSR and nitroaromatic compounds with high specificity, without compromising its attractive behavior even after undergoing repeated mechanical stress. This new integrated sampling/detection fingertip strategy holds considerable promise as a rapid, effective and low-cost approach for on-site crime scene investigations in various forensic scenarios.

This protocol implements the orthogonal identification of the presence of GSR utilizing square-wave stripping voltammetry (SWSV) as a rapid screening tool along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm the presence of the characteristic morphology and metal composition of GSR particles. This is achieved through the judicious modification of the working electrode of a carbon screen-printed electrode (CSPE) with carbon tape (used in SEM analysis) to fix and retain a sample. A comparison between a subject who has handled and loaded a firearm and a subject who has had no contact with GSR shows the significant variations in voltammetric signals and the presence or absence of GSR-consistent particles and constituent metals. This initial electrochemical screening has no effect on the integrity of the metallic particles, and SEM/EDX analysis conducted prior to and postvoltammetry show no differences in analytical output. The carbon tape is instrumental in retaining the GSR sample after electrochemical analysis, supported by comparison with orthogonal detection at a bare CSPE. This protocol shows great promise as a two-tier detection system for the presence of GSR from the hands of a subject, whereby initial screening can be conducted rapidly onsite by minimally trained operators; confirmation can follow at the same substrate to substantiate the voltammetric results.

The present study introduces the elemental analysis of the GSRs by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer analysis (ICP-AES) performed on skin samples. ICP-AES was used to increase the accuracy of the analysis in gunshots fired from long and medium distance. In this experimental study, a series of 50 test shots have been performed in an open space with lateral wind protection. As target we used pig skin cut into 20. cm. a—. 20. cm squares. The firing distances were 0.2, 5, 50, 100 and 150. cm. To exclude environmental contamination, each skin sample was carefully washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature in a closed box before the shooting test. We choose 9. a—. 21 and the 7.65. mm calibers handguns, loaded with different ammunitions. At ICP-AES analysis a clearly decreasing trend in the quantity and the concentration of the different elements of GSR by increasing the firing distance for both the guns used in the test was evident for every portion of skin samples analyzed. The analytical results obtained by ICP-AES confirmed very high concentrations of Pb, Sb, and Ba in the close-range shots and low concentrations of these particles in the intermediate and distant shots. In particular, the concentration of Sb, Ba, and Pb was significantly different from loose values when the firing distance was 100-150. cm for both the 9. a—. 21 and the 7.65. mm calibers.

The most reliable characteristic is the presence of bullet wipe, a carbonaceous and lead deposit surrounding the margin of the defect. Bullet wipe can be detected visually and/or with the use of a colorimetric reagent but there are cases in which bullet wipe is not detectable and other methods of analysis must be used. A bullet perf orating fabric may generate a large number of severed fibers protruding in a common direction around the margin of the bullet hole. The direction of these fibers may or may not indicate the direction of bullet travel. In cases in which fabric alone is perforated, the fiber direction may indicate the bullet direction, but when fabric is backed by a human body, the fibers are subject to significant movement opposite the bullet's direction of travel. Fibers may actually extend away from the body and back toward the source of the shot. While counter-intuitive, this phenomenon has been studied and documented through high speed videography. The same cloth or garment struck by the same type of bullet at comparable impact velocities while free-hanging or un-shore d by soft tissue or a tissue simulant does not show this effect.

Materials and methods: Thirty firing trials were carried out at a distance of 15. cm. Six shooting experiments were performed on human calves covered with a single layer of textile; the other 24 firing trials were carried out on bare skin sections.The bare skin specimens (n=6) and those covered by textile specimens (n=6) were immediately formalin-fixed. The remaining gunshot wounds were submerged in water for 1. day (n=6), or enclosed in a cowshed for 15 days (n=6) or placed inside a wood-burning stove for 4. min (n=6). The entrance and exit wounds were analyzed macroscopically and microscopically, as well as radiologically using a micro-CT, and the results were compared by blinded investigators. Results: At visual inspection, the differential diagnosis between entrance and exit holes was possible only in fresh and submerged gunshot wounds, while the skin of the other types of lesions did not show any of the classical morphological features of entrance wounds.Micro-CT analysis detected radiopaque particles in each experimental sample only on the EntW, while on the ExtW no gunshot residue (GSR) deposits were evident. Conclusion: Micro-CT analysis detected GSR in EntW, allowing the performance of a differential diagnosis from the ExtW. This objective and rapid tool may furnish precious information for reconstructing the shooting incident in firearm fatalities.

Analysis of GCO subsequently deposited on a target was performed using pentane extraction and gas chromatography. (Hoppe's GCO was used here as a model.) When a 0.45 caliber handgun was used, analysis reveals that most of the GCO wiped from the barrel does not survive, owing to the elevated temperatures encountered. However, two components of the GCO, a long-chain fatty acid and its ethyl ester, do survive and can be detected in the bullet wipe.

Among several highly sensitive methods, atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) is employed to analyze GSR in the laboratory. However, it is sometimes necessary to identify bullet holes immediately at a crime scene. The purpose of this examination was to determine whether the use of the field test Bullet Hole Testing Kit 3 (BTK3) on a suspected bullet hole would influence the outcome of AAS-analysis: Three commonly encountered firearms (Glock17, Tokarev, and Colt) were fired at skin, wood, and cloth. AAS-analysis was performed with and without previous BTK3 application. The results clearly indicate that there is no significant interaction on the grounds of BTK3 use (BTK3 vs. no-BTK3 [kit_nokit] [Pb: p = 0.1309; Sb: p = 0.9111], material*kit_nokit [Pb: p = 0.5960; Sb: p = 0.9930], distance*kit_nokit [Pb: p = 0.4014; Sb: p = 0.9184], and firearm type*kit_nokit [Pb: p = 0.9662; Sb: p = 0.9885]); hence, applying this field kit does not falsify later AAS outcomes.

The muzzle to target distance is usually estimated by examining the bullet entrance hole and the gunshot residue pattern. To visualize the pattern the forensic analyst usually uses presumptive tests based on color chemical reactions that are applied using long and tedious proceedings. Due to the drawbacks of the chemical tests recent developments for shooting distance estimation not based on color chemical tests were described in the literature. The present review covers the approaches for shooting distance estimation published in the last 10 years considering two types of target, clothing and skin.

It is often accomplished with chemical tests, which can reveal elements and ions indicating the presence of GSR, but are likely to cause physical alteration to the pattern. In this study, the Spex Forensics Mini-CrimeScope MCS 400, along with 16 accompanying wavelength filters, was applied to various GSR patterns and target types. Three dark shirt materials, four ammunition calibers, and eight ammunition manufacturers, along with the primer residue of the different manufacturer ammunitions were tested. Results indicate the alternate light source wavelength of 445 nm to be the optimal setting. In addition, target material plays a large role in the preservation of GSR patterns as particles burn. Furthermore, it can be extrapolated that residue, observed from a full round and firing distance of six inches, is mostly composed of unburnt gunpowder residue, not primer residue.

The marker containing Eu3+ ion was synthesized producing the [Eu(PIC)3(NMK)3] complex, where PIC is picric acid and NMK is n-methyl caprolactam. It was chemically characterized using emission spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses, and electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS) and then added to conventional ammunition as function of its concentration (from 2 to 50mg by ammunition). Marked conventional GSR was visually and chemically detected by UV irradiation (Î»=395nm) and ESI-FT-ICR MS. The tests indicated that marked GSR is easily visible in proportions above of 25mg on the target, bullets and firearms regions and on the arm of shooter. It was also detected at lower concentrations using ESI-FT-ICR MS. A final cost of the process is evaluated be lower than US$ 1.50/by ammunition, where 1g of marker suffices to tag approximately 40 .40 bullets.

Prof. Luiz Freire, S/N, Recife, 50740-540, Brazil","Chemical evaluation of gunshot residues (GSR) produced by non-toxic lead-free ammunition (NTA) has been a challenge to forensic analyses. Our group developed some luminescent markers specific to the detection of GSR. Here, we evaluated the performance of selected markers in experiments that mimic forensic context and/or routines in which luminescent characteristics would be very useful. We evaluated the influence of markers' addition on the bullet's speed, the rate of shot failure (i.e., when the cartridge case is not fully ejected and/or a new ammunition is not automatically replaced in the gun chamber) as a function of marker percentage, the possibility of collecting luminescent gunshot residue (LGSR) in unconventional locations (e.g. the shooters' nostrils), the LGSR lifetime after hand washing, the transfer of LGSR to objects handled by the shooter, and the dispersion of LGSR at the crime scene and on simulated victims. It was observed that high amounts of marker (10. wt%) cause high rates of failure on pistols, as well as a substantial decrease in bullet speed. However, the use of 2. wt% of marker minimizes these effects and allows LGSR detection, collection and analysis. Moreover, in all conditions tested, markers showed high performance and provided important information for forensic analyses. For instance, the LGSR particles were found on the floor, ranging from 0 to 9.4. m away from the shooter, on the door panel and seats after a car shooting experiment, and were found easily on a pig leg used to simulate a victim. When a selective tagging was done, it was possible to obtain positive or negative correlation between the victim and shooter. Additionally LGSR possesses a fairly long lifetime (9. h) and good resistance to hand washing (up to 16 washes).

At present, methodologies based on the analysis of inorganic particles found in GSR are not amenable to rapid presumptive testing in the field or laboratory settings. An alternative is to target the organic analytes that are vaporized during the firing event and then re-condense on skin and other surfaces, such as clothing. Previous studies have demonstrated that the persistence of organic compounds, such as diphenylamine (DPA), from hand swabs of shooters as detected using commercial ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) instruments was 3-4 h. These same studies indicated that secondary transfer did not occur, which implied that losses of the organic compounds were attributable to absorption into the skin. The goal of this study was to assess the dermal absorption characteristics of organic gunshot residue (OGSR) using IMS. Two studies were conducted. First, a qualitative IMS method was developed for the in vitro analysis of select OGSR compounds. In vitro studies with medical grade silicone were conducted using Franz diffusion cells (FDCs). The results from this study demonstrated that OGSR was dermally absorbed. Second, a semi-quantitative IMS method was developed for an in vitro study of DPA. The skin permeability of DPA (Kp) was experimentally determined to be 2.6 a— 10-2 cm/hr, the steady state flux (Jss) was 13 Î¼g cm-2 hr-1, and the lag time was 8.9 h. The results show excellent correlation with the 3-4 h persistence previously reported.

Recent concerns regarding the interpretation of GSR evidence has led to interest in alternatives such as the organic constituents (organic gunshot residue, OGSR) found in propellants. Previous work has shown OGSR to be detectable on hands for several hours after a firing event, and given the lipophilic nature of these compounds, it was expected that losses due to secondary transfer (an issue with GSR particulates) would be negligible. However, other loss mechanisms have been identified, specifically skin permeation and evaporation. This paper describes experimental and modeling studies used to elucidate characteristics of skin permeation of 5 compounds present in OGSR. Pharmaceutical methods were adapted to characterize skin permeation using a skin surrogate and Franz diffusion cells. The amount of compounds deposited on skin after an authentic firing event (1 and 2 shots) was experimentally determined and applied for the permeation experiments. A fully validated selected ion monitoring GC/MS method was developed for quantitative analysis, and easily accessible online tools were employed for modeling. Results showed that OGSR residues should be detectable on skin for many hours after a firing event of as few as one or two shots, with detection capability being a function of the efficacy of sampling and sample preparation and the instrumental method employed. The permeation rates of the OGSR compounds were sufficiently different to suggest the potential to develop methods to approximate time-since-deposition.

The analysis of volatile gunshot residue remaining after shooting using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography (GC) was proposed to meet this objective. However, current interpretative models suffer from several conceptual drawbacks which render them inadequate to assess the evidential value of a given measurement. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a logical approach based on the assessment of likelihood ratios. A probabilistic model was thus developed and applied to a hypothetical scenario where alternative hypotheses about the discharge time of a spent cartridge found on a crime scene were forwarded. In order to estimate the parameters required to implement this solution, a non-linear regression model was proposed and applied to real published data. The proposed approach proved to be a valuable method for interpreting aging-related data.

Published approaches are based on following the decrease of selected target compounds as a function of time by using solid phase micro-extraction (SPME). Naphthalene as well as an unidentified decomposition product of nitrocellulose (referred to as ""TEA2"") are usually employed for this purpose. However, reliability can be brought into question given their high volatility and low reproducibility of the extracted procedure. In order to identify alternatives and therefore develop improved dating methods, an extensive study on the composition and variability of volatile residues in nine different types of cartridges was carried out. Analysis was performed using headspace sorptive extraction (HSSE), which is a more exhaustive technique compared to SPME. One hundred sixty six compounds were identified (several of which for the first time), and it was observed that the final compositional characteristics of each residue were strongly dependent on its source. Variability of single identified compounds within and between different types of cartridge as well as their evolution over time were also studied. Many explosion products containing up to four aromatic rings were found to be globally present in high proportions. Twenty-seven of them (excluding naphthalene) also presented detectable decreases during the first 24 h. Therefore, they could be used as complementary target analytes in future dating methods.

Both types of residue play an important role in establishing various circumstances of a shooting crime, though the most vital one concerns the possibility of relating a suspect with the activity of shooting. In this aspect, solid, inorganic particles, nowadays called characteristic, have been utilized. Their specific features result from the primer mixture composition, including compounds of heavy metals, lead, antimony, and barium, and from the extraordinarily dynamic conditions of their formation, taking place at the moment of the primer detonation. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis techniques proved to be necessary and sufficient to reveal the content and the spherical morphology of the particles for this purpose. Recently, the recommendation that the potential for lead exposure be minimized was followed in the production of ammunition cal. 9Â mm Luger, 0.40Â S&W, 0.380 Auto, and 0.38 Special. These modern types of ammunition expel less characteristic particles, the identification of which can be a challenge for the examiners. At least two solutions to strengthen the residue identity are taken into account: additional insights into the internal structure of inorganic particles, e.g., by means of electron backscattered diffraction and focused ion beam, as well as complementary examinations of organic residues with sensitive mass spectrometric techniques.

With a characteristic elemental composition of lead, antimony, barium, and a typically discriminative spheroidal morphology, the presence and distribution of GSR can aid in firearm investigations. In this experiment, three shots of low velocity rim-fire ammunition were fired over polished silicon collection substrates placed at six intervals over a 100 cm range. The samples were analysed using a Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope (FEG-SEM) in conjunction with an X-flash Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector, allowing for GSR particle analyses of composition and structure at the sub-micron level. The results of this experiment indicate that although classic spheroidal particles are present consistently throughout the entire range of samples their sizes vary significantly, and at certain distances from the firearm particles with an irregular morphology were discerned, forming â€œimpact-disruptedâ€ GSR particles, henceforth colloquially referred to as â€œsplatsâ€. Upon further analysis, trends with regards to the formation of these splat particles were distinguished. An increase in splat frequency was observed starting at 10 cm from the firearm, with 147 mmâˆ’2 splat density, reaching a maximal flux at 40 cm (451 mmâˆ’2), followed by a gradual decrease to the maximum range sampled. Moreover, the structural morphology of the splats changes throughout the sampling range. At the distances closest to the firearm, molten-looking particles were formed, demonstrating the metallic residues were in a liquid state when their flight path was disrupted. However, at increased distances-primarily where the discharge plume was at maximum dispersion and moving away from the firearm, the residues have had time to cool in-fight resulting in semi-congealed and solid particles that subsequently disrupted upon impact, forming more structured as well as disaggregated splats. The relative compositions of the characteristic elements that are present in GSR also change in the different splat morphologies sampled, which may contribute to the particles' physical structures. Two distinct populations of splats were also observed: circular and elongated, which suggest the residues hit the substrate at different angles. The difference in the splat impact angle can be ascribed to the position of the residues within the firearm discharge plume; particles get caught up in the vortex that is created by the discharge gases behind the projectile as it leaves the barrel, thereby affecting their directionality and flight time. This reasoning could also justify the existence of both spheroidal and splat particles at certain distances. The novel sampling and analytical techniques used in this experiment have provided previously unknown information in relation to GSR structure and formation which could have greater implications to its current analysis amongst laboratories and law enforcement agencies worldwide.

GSR analyses are usually based upon the elemental composition and morphological appearance of very minute particles by means of SEM-EDS. Based on these two parameters, GSR particles are divided into specified classes. The amount of detected GSR particles depends on the time since discharge of the weapon and the sampling position relative to the location of discharge. In this paper, the influence of time on the local concentration and the distribution of airborne GSR particles were investigated with impactor technology. The particle concentration is constant in the still room; changes in concentration are only related to the emission of GSR particles by the discharge of a firearm. Here we showed that large quantities (50% of max. concentration) of airborne GSR particles can be detected several hours after discharge and contamination can take place as much as three hours after discharge. This study is a first approach to describe the propagation and sedimentation of GSR particles. With respect to statistical confirmation further experiments are already projected in order to comprehend the well-known variability of GSR emission and behavior.

SEM/EDX analysis of these particles highlighted a particle with defined domains containing distinct groups of elements. Some of these elements were absent in the primers mixtures of the ammunition used in the shooting event. X-ray mapping indicated that these domains might have been incorporated into the particle within several shooting cycles.

Due to the health risks often associated with lead, the use of lead-free primers in ammunitions is becoming more popular. Thus, the presence of GSR is becoming more difficult to discern based on the traditional means, i.e. the presence of lead (Pb), barium (Ba), and antimony (Sb). While research has been conducted on the differences between lead-based and lead-free muzzle discharge residue, few have researched other components of ammunition which may lead to other means of characterizing GSR. This research, therefore, covers that gap by focusing on the priming cup present in ammunition and the residue which may originate from it, that can contribute to muzzle discharge residue. In this study, a lead-based and a lead-free ammunition from four different manufacturers were chosen. The cartridges were fired using a Glock 17, 9Â mm Parabellum, collected post-fire, and subsequently de-primed resulting in the removal of the anvil. The GSR present on the anvils and cups was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (SEMâ€“EDX). The data was then processed using unit vector analysis for normalization and analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This data was then used to determine the components of the cartridge case which contribute to GSR and develop a method of characterization between lead-free and lead-based ammunition. Such a method will improve the detection of GSR by strengthening the criteria of identification.",GSR; SEM-EDX; characterization; lead-based; lead-free,,Article,,,,,,IFSMS 2019,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

Elemental analysis, performed by a Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS), is the most discriminating method for characterizing inorganic GSR particles, and forensic procedures based on SEM-EDS are followed worldwide. The SWGGSR â€œGuide for Primer Gunshot Residue Analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry 11-29-11â€ refers to â€œGun bluingâ€ but Se (and also Cr) is not included among those elements whose presence is allowed in particles which are â€œcharacteristic of GSRâ€, neither according to the SWGGSR guide itself nor the current relevant ASTM â€œStandard guide for gunshot residue analysis by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopyâ€ E1588-16. Whenever unusual elements are found in alleged GSR particles, a â€œcase by caseâ€ approach is recommended, and suitable research and documentation is required. In the present paper the authors show evidences of the presence of selenium in lead, barium and antimony (characteristic of) GSR particles detected in casework by laboratories placed both in Europe (Italy and The Netherlands) and in Australia. Firearm bluing products containing selenious acid has been experimentally proven to be a reasonable source for selenium in inorganic GSR particles. For the first time, a case-by-case approach is adopted to support fruitful interpretation of GSR particles containing selenium.

Samplers were loaded with target GSR followed by dabbing 30 times on the back of a hand. Backscatter electron images were taken at 20Â kV and for some at 30Â kV of the same areas. The samplers were then treated with a sodium/calcium hypochlorite solution (bleach) to remove skin debris and again imaged in the SEM.

The research has been largely focused on their collection onto the hands of suspected shooters, but the method is often burdened by risks of contamination. This research was focused on the possibility of sampling GSR trapped inside the nasal mucus of consenting shooters. Samples of the nasal mucus of â€œblankâ€ control subjects and shooters were chemically analysed by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA), for residues of antimony (Sb) and barium (Ba), while lead (Pb) was excluded as ubiquitously environmental contaminant and due to high instrumental quantification limit (IQL) of INAA for this element. Shots were fired using two types of weapons (pistols and revolvers) and different firing sequences. The mucus was sampled at different times: immediately after the shots, after 30â€“60â€“120 and 180Â min. Different amounts of Sb and Ba were detected between controls and shooters, witnessing the ability of the nasal mucus to retain GSR at concentrations significantly different even from the highest basal levels. Moreover, in order to simulate actual cases, nasal mucus from five groups of shooters was sampled after different shots with the same weapon and cartridges, immediately and after 1, 3, 12, and 24Â h. The highest values were always found in the first 3Â h from firing, for both weapons. Interestingly, for all the weapons, significant Sb and Ba concentrations were also found up to 12Â h after firing, contrary to what occursÂ on hands, even though a progressive decrease was detected, with values below the detection threshold only after 24Â h, thus demonstrating that GSR are persistent in nasal mucus. These first results proving that both Sb and Ba were qualitatively detectable in the nasal mucus of shooters indicate that the chemical analysis of the nasal mucus of suspected shooters may represent a promising tool in the forensic field since it is less burdened by problems related to sampling or contamination than the usual sampling on hand, providing that ammunitions employed contain Ba and Sb.

But these residues disappear through contact with surfaces or washing. Therefore, the maximum time frame to find GSR on a suspect's hands is 8 h. The mucus, inside of a nostril, forms a surface layer where they are trapped foreign particles. In this way, mucus inside of a gunshot suspect's nostrils could act like an adhesive medium to stick on it gaseous particles from a gunshot. In this study, the presence of GSR in nasal mucus and its residence time is examined. A new procedure for the sampling of possible gunshot residue accumulated in the nasal mucus is designed. Samples are taken with cotton swabs moistened with a solution of EDTA and, after an acid digestion, are analysed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. In addition, samples of hands are taken for comparison purposes. GSR recovery has been successful. The concentration of GSR in nasal mucus is found to be lower than on the hands, but with a longer residence time. Thus, it is possible to expand the sampling time of a suspect also, as nasal mucus cannot be contaminated by handling weapons.

GSRs have characteristic sizes and morphologies and consist of a combination of lead, antimony and barium, as well as other elements. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) is a widely accepted technique for the analysis of these residues; however, little has been reported on samples taken from the nostrils of the suspect that discharged the shot. The analysis of residues found on hands has been more frequent. This article presents a device (Nasal Stub) developed by us for the non-invasive collection of GSR particles from the nostrils and a platform also developed by us to contain these devices that is compatible with SEM-EDS. To evaluate the effectiveness of our Nasal Stub to collect GSR particles from nose hairs, four types of firearms of different calibers were utilized. Nasal samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 20 h after firing. The results show that the nasal device was able to recover GSR particles from nose hairs for all the weapons used, even, in some cases, over 20 h after firing.

Herein, the ability of the ICP-MS technique is evaluated to determine the gunshot residues (GSR) from clean range ammunition using a 0.40 caliber pistol and a 0.38 caliber revolver as a function of number of shots (n = 1â€“7 shots for the pistol and n = 1â€“5 shots for the revolver). The GSR was collected on the two regions of right and left hands: thumb and forefinger palm and thumb and forefinger back. ICP-MS results were compared to classical techniques in the forensic ballistics: the colorimetric test using sodium rhodizonate reagent and scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDX). Negative results were found for Pb and Ba using the colorimetric test from GSR with n = 7 shots from 0.40 caliber pistol. For SEM/EDX analysis, photomicrographs show indefinite morphology for the GSR of clean range ammunition, in contrast to reported by conventional GSR. Moreover, the EDX results primarily identified C, O, K, Al, S, Si, Cu, Zn, Ti, Cr, Cl, Mo, Sr, and Fe. Differently, ICP-MS provided positive results for Pb, Ba and Sb, with maximum concentrations of 4.20 Î¼gÂ·Lâˆ’ 1, 10.9 Î¼gÂ·Lâˆ’ 1 and 0.119 Î¼gÂ·Lâˆ’ 1, respectively, as well as for Al, Ti, Cr, Mo, Cu, Zn and Sr. Finally, Al, Zn, Cu and Sr can be used as new markers of GSR of clean range ammunition, since they are the most abundant species detected.

Moreover, information on particles taken from cartridge cases shows the relative feeble importance of the morphology in distinguishing gunshot residues (GSRs). Furthermore, also the presence in the spectrum of other elements (e.g., iron) is not so conclusive. In this panorama, the possibility of discriminating gunshot residue particles from other non-firearm lead-antimony-barium aggregates is investigated: the proposed method is based on X-ray mapping technique - currently applied used in Reparto Carabinieri Investigazioni Scientifiche in Rome, the forensic service of Italian Carabinieri - according to which the spatial distribution of the emission energy of each element of the sample is pictured. Gunshot residues present the same lead-antimony-barium distribution (or at least the same antimony-barium distribution with lead nodules), as some other environmental occupational aggregates do not (different plaques of lead, antimony, and barium). So, X-ray mapping technique can offer a new fundamental evaluation parameter in analysis of gunshot residues with scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive (SEM/EDS) spectrometry, and new standards could be considered.

These studies, published in the early 2000s, coincided with the reduction or removal of unnecessary sources of lead from the automotive industry. The question therefore arises whether modern brake pads might still be a relevant source of â€˜GSR-likeâ€™ particles. In the present study, a total of 75 brake pads taken from a range of cars currently on the road in Adelaide, South Australia, were collected from service centres. These pads were screened by XRF, and 12 were selected as representatives of the types of pads available on the market. Some pads generated XRF results for elements particularly relevant to GSR analysis. Signals for barium and antimony were commonly observed, with some pads showing results possibly attributable to lead. The surfaces of these 12 pads were directly sampled using aluminium stubs equipped with carbon-filled adhesive tape. Following this, they were screened using SEM-EDS and an automated GSR particle search in order to detect particles containing lead, barium or antimony. No particles containing all of these elements were found, although a large number of particles containing both barium and antimony were located. Other particulate samples were collected using stubs from persons or objects associated with brakes in order to examine whether particles similar to GSR might be present on them. No three-component particles were detected in samples collected from the wheel rims or the hands of those exposed to automobiles. From this study of common, contemporary cars, brake pads and brake pad technicians, it was determined that the possibility of obtaining three-component â€˜GSR-likeâ€™ particles from brake pads appears to be much lower now than when this issue was first raised in the early 2000s. While some brake pads do produce particles containing barium and antimony, they are often angular particles that contain sulphur. Furthermore, these â€˜GSR-likeâ€™ particles are commonly found together with an abundance of particles containing iron. The particle evidence evaluated in total allows clear differentiation between residues originating from brakes and residues originating from firearms.

In this work, the chemical composition of six brands of nontoxic ammunition was investigated and compared to that of a road flare, which served as an environmental source with similar composition. Five rounds of each brand were fired while a further five were disassembled and the primer alone was fired. Particles collected from all samples, including the road flare, were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Common elements among the different ammunition brands included aluminum, potassium, silicon, calcium, and strontium. Spectra were then subjected to principal components analysis in which association of the primer to the intact ammunition sample was generally possible, with distinction among brands and from the road flare sample. Further, PCA loadings plots indicated the elements responsible for the association and discrimination observed.

Therefore, the random prevalence of GSR and 'GSR-like' residues in the wider population is a highly pertinent question when considering the probative value of such evidence. The random prevalence of GSR in two Australian jurisdictions - Victoria and South Australia - was assessed through the collection and analysis of GSR samples obtained from randomly selected members of the public. Volunteers were asked to declare any firearms use, hobbies or potential firearms exposure before allowing their hands to be sampled using aluminium GSR sample stubs coated in adhesive tape. A total of 289 samples, 120 from Victoria and 169 from South Australia were collected and analysed using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDS). Across all samples, three 'characteristic' three-component Pb/Ba/Sb particles were detected from a single subject in South Australia, corresponding to an overall prevalence of 0.3%. Two-component 'consistent' particles were more prevalent, with Pb/Sb particles being the most frequently occurring, in 8% of samples, and in South Australia only. A number of samples, approximately 7%, showed populations of single element particles of Pb, Ba and Sb, which has the potential to generate a false positive for GSR if using a bulk analysis technique such as NAA or AAS. The prevalence of GSR or 'GSR like' particles in this study matches closely with similar surveys conducted in other jurisdictions. Such surveys are a useful foundation for the creation of a probabilistic method for the assessment of GSR evidence.

In specimens taken from hands of 100 people declaring no contact with firearms only one spherical particle containing lead, antimony and barium was found. Numbers of particles found in specimens collected from hands of 50 shooters varied from zero to numbers greater than 100 and were strongly correlated with the time interval between last shooting and collecting specimens. Within the first 4. h after shooting particles are being lost from the shooter's hands, and so transferred from shooters to their environment. Thus, the relatives of five hunters were examined during both the close and open hunting seasons to trace the potential secondary transfer in practice. Using the criterion of low risk of contamination with gunshot residue, i.e. 5. h after last handling a gun, only few specimens were encountered among these collected from hands of firearm users that contained characteristic particles and these occurred in small numbers. Frequent shooters, e.g. shooting instructors or firearm examiners, formed a class for themselves of high risk of contamination with gunshot residue. As a result of continuous monitoring of the laboratory (55 specimens examined so far), where the examinations of gunshot residue are being carried out, it has been proved that the laboratory is free from contamination and so confirmed the usefulness of protocols worked out. The obtained information provided empirical bases to the minimisation of the risk of contamination of the evidence as well as for the evaluation of the analytical findings in the expertise on gunshot incidents.

The application of this approach to interpreting the finding of gunshot residue on the clothing of a suspect requires knowledge of background levels of GSR on clothing and on the frequency of different residue types in a particular environment. The cuffs of 100 upper outer garments submitted to a forensic laboratory in connection with non-firearms offences were sampled for gunshot residue. No 3-component lead/antimony/barium particles were found on 98 of them. Two 3-component particles were found on one of them and one 3-component particle was found on another. The frequency of occurrence of various particle types regarded as consistent with GSR was also explored. The findings show that, while 3-component particles were somewhat more likely to be encountered by chance on clothing than on hands, they are still relatively uncommon events. To investigate the frequency of occurrence of particular residue types, 100 discharged rounds of ammunition recovered at crime scenes were sampled and the types of residue present were determined. The results show that some residue types are significantly more common than others.

With an increase of â€œlead freeâ€ ammunition, testing for both gunpowder and primer GSR is relevant. Seventy samples were collected using carbon-coated adhesive stubs from four Pittsburgh Police Stations and vehicles to investigate these locations as sources of secondary GSR contamination. These seventy samples were analyzed for primer GSR using scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry. One primer GSR particle was detected; no sample was classified as positive for primer GSR. These same samples were then analyzed for gunpowder GSR using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to test for akardite II, ethylcentralite, diphenylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, 2-nitrodiphenylamine, and 4-nitrodiphenylamine. Ethylcentralite was quantifiable in two test samples. These results suggest there is a negligible potential for secondary transfer of primer and gunpowder GSR.

The driver of vehicle 1 stopped and allegedly fired two shots from within his vehicle over the heads of the driver and passenger of vehicle 2 when they were out of their vehicle. The driver of vehicle 2, an off-duty police officer, fired his.45 calibre pistol at the driver of vehicle 1. The bullet went through the windshield and lodged in the instrument panel. Eight gunshot residue (GSR) samples were taken from the interior of vehicle 1 and analysed by automated scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The results show for vehicle 1 that a firearm discharged with its breach or cylinder gap within the vehicle was unlikely to have occurred and the.45 calibre bullet which impacted five surfaces of vehicle 1 was accompanied by GSR throughout its travel. A recreational shooter is shown in this study to transfer GSR to the seat of his car. The driver of vehicle 1 visited a recreational gun range prior to the altercation, which would explain the significant GSR contamination of the driver's seat of his vehicle.

With advances in technology, the forensic challenges presented by these traces, known as gunshot residues (GSR), are moving from the analytical domain to the interpretation of the analytical results. Different interpretation frameworks are currently competing. Formal classification of particles, using standards such as that produced by ASTM, focusses only on evaluation of evidence at the sub-source level. Another approach, based on the application of Bayesian reasoning â€“ namely the case-by-case approach â€“ has been proposed that allows evaluation of evidence in regards to activity-related questions. This alternative approach allows an evaluation of the evidence that is more closely aligned to judicial and investigative aims.

A number of concomitant parameters including firearm and ammunition type, plume and GSR material characteristics, travel distances, chemical composition and GSR morphology are critically discussed in relation to their effects on the distribution and deposition, transfer and persistence processes of GSR. The underlying mechanisms associated with such processes are also considered. Knowledge of these processes on GSR materials could provide valuable information concerning scene preservation and subsequent forensic sampling. The number of GSR particles deposited can vary significantly with each firearm discharge, highlighting the potential to produce distinctive data in each individual case. With the continual development and compositional changes of new ammunition types, further evaluation of the effect these processes may have on GSR evidence and their possible influence on the interpretation of the analytical results should be given due consideration.

Choosing two Poisson distributions, the parameter Î» of the first one coincides with the mean number of GSRs that can be found on a firearm shooter, while the parameter Î¼ of the second one is the mean number of GSRs that can be found on a nonshooter.

LRs depend on the probabilistic models assumed for the defence proposition (the suspect was not involved in a shooting) and the prosecutor's proposition (the suspect was involved), and should be calculated based on data obtained in well designed experiments. However, statistical aspects of the analysis that select the appropriate model and provide uncertainty measures are rarely considered. In this article, data from Cardinetti et al. (2006, A proposal for statistical evaluation of the detection of gunshot residues on a suspect. Scanning, 28(3):142-147) are used to demonstrate the sensitivity of calculated LRs to the assumed model. It is shown that the Poisson model, considered by Cardinetti and others, is inappropriate and that a Negative Binomial model fits the data much better. The statistical error arising from the fact that models are estimated based on small sampled data is discussed, as well as the importance of accounting for this error. We conclude that only with a large database can statistical models be estimated accurately and LR's be treated as valid scientific measures.

In this study, GSR samples taken from seven different locations around and in the firearm were collected and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Four different types of ammunition were applied. Very low correlations were found when different ammunition were used. This clearly shows that it is possible to differentiate between ammunition types. When the same ammunition was used, high correlations were found between samples taken from external positions (such as hands of shooter, bullet-entrance holes) but poor correlation was found between internal samples (such as firearm barrel, cartridge case) and external samples. A high degree of association was found between samples that simulated victim and shooter. These findings clearly demonstrate that GSR comparison studies are meaningful but care needs to be taken when choosing suitable exhibits.

Each of these techniques has been extensively studied, especially on living individuals. The current studies (Part I and Part II) were designed to compare the use and utility of the different GSR testing techniques in a medical examiner setting. In Part I, the hands of deceased persons who died from undisputed suicidal handgun wounds were tested for GSR by SEM-EDX over a 4-year period. A total of 116 cases were studied and analyzed for caliber of weapon, proximity of wound, and results of GSR testing, including spatial deposition upon the hands. It was found that in only 50% of cases with a known self-inflicted gunshot wound was SEM-EDX positive for at least 1 specific particle for GSR. In 18% of the cases there was a discernible pattern (spatial distribution) of the particles on the hand such that the manner in which the weapon was held could be determined. Since only 50% of cases where the person is known to have fired a weapon immediately prior to death were positive for GSR by SEM-EDX, this test should not be relied upon to determine whether a deceased individual has discharged a firearm. Furthermore, in only 18% of cases was a discernible pattern present indicating how the firearm was held. The low sensitivity, along with the low percentage of cases with a discernible pattern, limits the usefulness of GSR test results by SEM-EDX in differentiating self-inflicted from non-self-inflicted wounds.

In order to ensure that such evidence is given appropriate evidential weighting when it comes to case investigations, the dynamics of the deposition and distribution of GSR must be understood. As the activity of the subject after firing is a major factor in the retention of GSR, cases of suicide involving a firearm provide an opportunity to assess GSR distribution where post-shooting activity is not an issue, assuming the subject had not been moved. Seventy-one cases of suicide by gunshot in South Australia between 1998 and 2014 were examined to collect data on firearm type, calibre, and gunshot residue test results. Overall, 47% of cases were found to produce GSR results that were not of high probative value, even though it was known that the shooter had fired a firearm. Of particular interest were cases involving 0.22 rimfire ammunition, for which characteristic particles are not expected due to lack of antimony present in the primer.

Analyzing all the particles in the second stage is time consuming with many particles classified by the initial automated system as being potentially GSRs excluded as such by the forensic examiner. In this paper, a new algorithm is developed to improve the initial classification step. The algorithm is based on a binary tree that was trained on almost 16,000 particles from 43 stubs used to sample hands of suspects. The classification algorithm was tested on 5,900 particles from 23 independent stubs and performed very well in terms of false positive and false negative rates. A routine use of the new algorithm can reduce significantly the analysis time of GSRs.

The method is rapid, and signals from hundreds of NPs can be collected in 1â€“2 min per sample. The technique is quantitative for NP mass and number concentration when only one element (single element mode) is measured using a quadrupole MS. Likewise, a qualitative elemental fingerprint can be obtained for individual NPs when peak-hopping between two elements (dual element mode). For this proof of concept study, each shooter's hand was sampled with ultrapure water or swab to obtain NPs suspensions. Measurements of antimony, barium, and lead were performed using both analysis modes. With no sample preparation and fully automated sample introduction, it is possible to analyze more than 100 samples in a day.

In this work a new sample introduction system, the subcritical fluid nebulizer (ScFN) combined with the flame furnace-atomic absorption spectrometry (FF-AAS) was applied for improving the determination of inorganic tin in aqueous solutions. Online preconcentration of tin as Sn-PDC complex was carried out in a HPLC-guard cartridge (5mm length, 2mm diameter) filled with C-18 coated monolithic silica having an absorption capacity of 2.5Î¼g of tin. For preconcentration optimized conditions were achieved at 0.015% (m/v) of APDC and pH5 obtaining a preconcentration factor of 17 using 2.5 mL of sample volume. The elution was done by means of subcritical liquid carbon dioxide and methanol with a flow rate of 1.5 L min-1 which was directly introduced as a dry aerosol into the flame furnace where tin complexes are vaporized and atomized. Applying ScFN-FF-AAS the detection and quantification limits for tin in water were 0.008 mg L-1 and 0.024 mg L-1, respectively, increasing the power of detection in 325 times compared to the conventional detection limits obtained by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The precision at 1 mg L-1 was 1.5% expressed as RSD (N=10). Tin was determined in samples of gunshot residues generated by firing four ammunition brands. The concentrations fluctuated between 52 and 151 Î¼g L-1.

The main purpose and the novelty of this paper fundamentally depend on assessment of the lifetime of GSR metals on the hands in terms of length of time after firing. The firearm used for the forensic GSR hand swab study was a Sarsilmaz Kilinc Mega 2000 pistol loaded with MKE 9 mm x 19 parabellum ammunition. The hand swab samples were collected from officers of the Turkish national police and were sampled at five different times after firing (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours, respectively). Prior to analysis, the samples were pretreated by addition of 5 mL of 8% (v/v) nitric acid, then shaken at 200 rpm (rotation per minute) for 30 minutes.

To that end, PIXE (Particle-Induced X-ray Emission), RBS (Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry) and micro-PIXE were employed in order to provide elemental characterization of three different ammunitions, namely CHOG, EXPO +P+ and Clean Range (CR). Pristine cartridges were taken apart for the characterization of bullets, cases, primer and propellant. Subsequently, shooting sessions were carried out and relatively large GSRs (of the order of 50â€“150 Î¼m across) ejected in the forward direction were collected and analyzed. The PIXE experiments were carried out employing 2.0 MeV protons with a beam spot size of 1 mm2. For the micro-PIXE experiments, the samples were irradiated with 2.2 MeV proton beams of 2 a— 2 Î¼m2. Finally, 1.2 MeV alpha particles were used for the RBS experiments. Quantitative analyzes were obtained for all constituents of the cartridges. The results show that elements like Pb, Ba and Sb are present in the primer of CHOG and EXPO +P+ ammunitions. Traces of Ba and Pb were found in the CR primers as well, while Sb is absent from these primers. The morphology of the GSRs reveals a spherical-like shape for GSRs from EXPO +P+ and Clean Range ammunitions. On the other hand, particles with an uneven shape were detected for the CHOG ammunition.

These methods offer superior information by simultaneous detection of organic and inorganic gunshot residues, including a substantial number of elements used in modern ammunition. Moreover, the selected analytical scheme permits subsequent confirmatory analysis (SEM-EDS) on the same sample. The rapid scanning of the laser-beam favors the identification of up to 5 different emission lines per target element in less than one minute, with repeatability better than 11% RSD and limits of detection for the species of interest in the range of 0.2â€“200 ng. Optimization of the electrochemical sensors demonstrated the feasibility of Square Wave Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (SWASV) for the rapid detection of inorganic and organic target compounds using carbon printed disposable electrodes (repeatability less than 8% RSD, detection limits 0.1â€“1 ng/ÂµL, linearity > 0.991). The separation and detection of mixtures of Pb, Sb, Cu, DNT, and NG was possible after LIBS analysis, in approximately 3 min per sample. A set of 112 samples, 20 samples from non-shooters and 92 samples from 28 shooters, were collected as part of the validation study.

Metrics of performance, such as error rates (false positives and false negatives), specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy, indicate the combination of LIBS and electrochemical methods are a reliable and promising approach to advance current practice.

Currently, there is a real need of methods capable of furnishing simultaneous elemental analysis with higher specificity for the GSR pattern visualization. Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) provides a multi-elemental analysis of the sample, requiring very small amounts of material and no sample preparation. Due to these advantages, this study aims at exploring the potential of LIBS imaging for the visualization of GSR patterns. After the spectral characterization of individual GSR particles, the distribution of Pb, Sb and Ba over clothing targets, shot from different distances, were measured in laser raster mode. In particular, an array of spots evenly spaced at 800Â Î¼m, using a stage displacement velocity of 4Â mm/s and a laser frequency of 5Â Hz was employed (e.g. an area of 130Â a—Â 165Â mm2 was measured in less than 3Â h). A LIBS set-up based on the simultaneous use of two spectrographs with iCCD cameras and a motorized stage was used. This set-up allows obtaining information from two different wavelength regions (258â€“289 and 446â€“463Â nm) from the same laser induced plasma, enabling the simultaneous detection of the three characteristic elements (Pb, Sb, and Ba) of GSR particles from conventional ammunitions. The ability to visualize the 2D distribution GSR pattern by LIBS may have an important application in the forensic field, especially for the ballistics area.

However, recent environmental concerns are trending toward an industry-wide shift to the manufacture and distribution of lead-free ammunition. Consequently, this change will require new methods that can be used to fully characterize the composition of lead-free gunshot residues. Spectrochemical analysis of simulated lead-free gunshot residues, in a proof of concept study, was used to identify statistically significant analytical markers present in each composition by Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy. Rates of error associated with each simulation were determined by leave-one-out cross-validation.

Data from two experiments are presented in this work. One experiment focused on identifying prominent analytical markers present in lead-free GSR by LIBS while the other applied SEM-EDX to determine the degree of evidence preservation after LIBS analysis. Samples of GSR were collected via tape-lift method from the hands of volunteer shooters and instrumental analyses were conducted in triplicate. As a result, the lead-free ammunition analyzed in this work generated GSRs comprising primarily Ba, Al, Si, and/or K. Trace amounts of Ti, Fe, and S were also apparent in some compositions. Through SEM-EDX analysis, a spheroidal geometry consistent with traditional lead-containing GSR was observed. Additionally, it was determined that evidence is preserved after LIBS analysis which supports the implementation of LIBS as a rapid preliminary screening method followed by confirmatory testing via SEM-EDX on the preserved evidence.

As a result of reversing the electroosmotic flow, very fast analysis has been actualized, well-defined and separated ion peaks emerge in less than 4Â min. Besides, the limit of detection was improved by employing large volume sample stacking. Limit of detection values were 6.7 and 4.3Â Î¼M for nitrate and nitrite, respectively.

These markers are metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) formed by the ligand 1,4-H2BDC (teraphthalic acid) and the metals Zn2+, Eu3+ and Tb3+. The MOFs were synthesized by precipitation, using different ratios of zinc and lanthanides (1â€“100%). The synthesized MOFs were added to 9 mm NTA gunpowder and, after shots were fired, luminescent residues (LGSR) were visualized under UV radiation. The residues were collected and characterized by non-destructive techniques such as SEM-EDS and emission spectroscopy. All MOFs presented high luminescence. However, those with levels of Eu3+ above 10% or Tb3+ above 5% presented the best cost-benefit. Comparing with the marker containing only lanthanide ions, this represents a cost reduction of up to 7-times. Besides, the precipitation synthesis represents an innovation in developing crystalline, high luminescent and stable luminescent markers for GSR identification.

Elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis and infrared spectroscopy were important for structural elucidation, providing the following chemical structures: [Eu(TBZ)2(NO3)3]Â·H2O and [Tb(TBZ)2(NO3)3]Â·H2O, called as EuTBZ and TbTBZ, respectively. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was also performed. EuTBZ and TbTBZ emitted characteristic red (618 nm) and green (542 nm) light, corresponding to chromaticity coordinates (0.57; 0.40) and (0.23; 0.54), respectively. Emission quantum efficiency of EuTBZ 5D0 was 57%. TbTBZ showed higher quantum yield than EuTBZ, 35% against 0.2%. Forensic tests were performed using TbTBZ as a marker in the 9 mm ammunition allowing visualizing luminescent gunshot residues (GSR) on the target, weapon and cartridge. It can help experts in analyzing crime scene, directing GSR collection and providing an optical and chemical signature to GSR derived from non-toxic ammunition.

The lanthanide elements present in these luminescent materials act as characteristic chemical markers that, also, offer the great benefit of making gunshot residues (GSR) collection easier. Although the use of luminescent markers offers numerous advantages, and can be a reliable future option in the cartridge ammunition market, little or nothing is known about the interaction of the marker with the ammunition compounds after the shot. For the forensic laboratories, it is of utmost importance to anticipate the commercialization of tagged luminescent ammunition by knowing the type of particles produced after the discharge. That is, to investigate if markers merge with GSR to form single particles or, on the contrary, they form individual particles that travel separately from the GSR particles. In this work, conventional ammunition cartridges tagged with two types of luminescent markers were shot. Then, the particles produced were visualized under UV light on the floor, clothing targets and the shooter. The luminescent particles spread over the floor determined the shooter position and the bullet trajectory. The illumination of the shot targets allows the visualization of the GSR patterns only using a portable UV lamp, avoiding the use of colorimetric test. The GSR particles were collected and subjected to SEM-EDX and Raman spectroscopy analysis to get information about their inorganic and organic composition. The results indicated that part of the marker and the GSR merge and travel together. With this, particles composed by the marker and propellant organic compounds can be identified by Raman spectroscopy, and the unequivocal identification of the GSR and the marker can be achieved by SEM-EDX. Consequently, the luminescent particles detected under UV light improve the evidence collection and offer information about the GSR and the marker. Additionally, this study support the use of luminescent ammunition to study, for example, the transfer or persistence of GSR.

GSR analysis is very well established, but there is still a lack of methodology to identify GSR obtained from lead-free or â€˜non-toxic ammunition' (NTA). To identify GSR from NTA, we have proposed the incorporation of luminescent markers to provide an optical and chemical signature to GSR. Furthermore, the luminescent markers can open up prospectives for ammunition encoding by adjusting their composition. Herein, we report the distinction among GSR particles containing different MOF-based markers by analyzing their organic fractions using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) together with multivariate analysis (MCR-ALS). The method has been proven to be effective, non-destructive and fast in distinguishing marked GSR. It is possible to detect and correctly identify 72.2% of the samples, and all cases of misclassification are related to slight amount of material collected (8.3%) or confusion caused by one of the markers (19.4%). The study is developed in a forensic context of GSR analysis; however, the methodology described here is excellent and can be extrapolated to other applications that require distinguishing MOFs with different ligands.

In this perspective, a new europium-based photoluminescent complex (Eu(PIC)3(NMK)3, where PIC is picric acid and NMK is n-methyl-caprolactam) was tested as an optical marker for GSR identification in conventional ammunition used in a 38 revolver and a 40 pistol. However, information on the toxicity of this substance is not reported in the literature. This study aims to assess the acute toxicity of Eu(PIC)3(NMK)3, using the protocol 423 recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Toward that end, the behavior of female wild type mice (Mus musculus, C57BL/6) was observed for 14days and biochemical tests of liver function markers (AST, ALP, GGT, and albumin) and renal function markers (creatinine, urea, and protein concentrations) were performed. The experiments were begun at a marker dose of 50mgkg-1, increasing until the dose reached 2000mgkg-1. The marker for Eu(PIC)3(NMK)3 showed a median lethal dose (LD50) of 1000mgkg-1, which is classified as category 4 in the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals scale; therefore, it was considered to be of average toxicity. This GSR marker proved to be less toxic than the inorganic components found in conventional ammunition (especially Pb), thus justifying its promising use in forensic ballistics.

Recently developed non-toxic ammunition, however, requires a new methodology for its characterization. To overcome this drawback, the introduction of noncommercial luminescent markers in ammunition was proposed. These markers, synthesized and added to the gunpowder, presented as a versatile tool for GSR analysis, since they require UV radiation alone to visualize the luminescent GSR (LGSR). This has opened up new perspectives for understanding GSR behavior at a crime scene. This work aims to expand previous studies performed with the luminescent markers in forensic contexts, exploring four different important aspects related to GSR behavior. Using LGSR amount/dispersion and a series of blind tests with marked ammunition, we tried to (1) identify the shooter position; (2) estimate the shooting distance; (3) evaluate the influence of the pistol type on the LGSR distribution on the shooter's hands and guns; and (4) study the transference of LGSR by a chain of handshaking. For this purpose, a portable UV lamp (Î» = 254 nm) and/or techniques such as video spectral comparator (VSC) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDS) were used to visualize and analyze the residues. As a result, the observation of the LGSR enabled accurate determination of the shooter position and the firing distance without any chemicals. Besides, the LGSR were visualized on different kinds of pistols, regardless of firing mechanism. And finally, this study evidenced transference of residues from shaking hands with the shooter, which should be carefully considered when interpreting the results of a GSR analysis.

Seven sampling materials, namely two ""swab""-type and five ""stub""-type collection materials, were tested. The evaluation of sampling materials was systematically carried out by first analyzing blank extracts of the materials to check for potential interferences and determining matrix effects. Based on these results, the best four materials, namely cotton buds, polyester swabs, a tape from 3 M and PTFE were compared in terms of collection efficiency during shooting experiments using a set of 9 mm Luger ammunition. It was found that the tape was capable of recovering the highest amounts of OGSR. As tape-lifting is the technique currently used in routine for inorganic GSR, OGSR analysis might be implemented without modifying IGSR sampling and analysis procedure.

Collection using swabs and stubs was compared through sequential sampling in terms of amount of residues left on the hand of a shooter. While stubs collected nearly all residues, swabs left about 50% of the residues on the hands. Moreover, the study of storage conditions after sampling showed that stubs were more stable than swabs and could be held at room temperature without significant compound loss up to 2Â weeks. Then, shooting experiments were performed to evaluate transfer of OGSR. It was not possible to differentiate different brands of ammunition based on a single compound concentration. Moreover, a memory effect was identified when different ammunition was shot using the same firearm. Finally, various exposed skin surfaces and hair as well as clothing were sampled to estimate what surfaces might be the best targets for OGSR sampling by comparing results just after discharge and 2Â h after discharging a pistol. The results indicated that OGSR were more rapidly lost from hands than from clothing. Moreover, it was shown that the face and hair of a suspect might be contaminated through secondary transfer. Thus, OGSR might remain longer on other skin surfaces, hair and clothing than on the hands of a suspect. As a consequence, sampling should also include clothing, hair and face.

Commonly, the analysis focuses on inorganic particles incorporating elements derived from the primer. However, recent changes in ammunition formulations and possibility that particles from non-firearm sources can be indistinguishable from certain primer particles challenge the standard operational protocol and call for adjustments, namely the combination of inorganic and organic GSR analysis. Two protocols for the combined collection and subsequent analysis of inorganic and organic GSR were developed and optimised for 15 compounds potentially present in organic GSR (OGSR). These protocols were conceptualised to enable OGSR analysis by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with UV detection and triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (confirmation) and IGSR analysis by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). Using liquid extraction, the extraction recoveries from spiked swabs and stubs were âˆ¼80 % (50-98 % for swabs, 64-98 % for stubs). When the mixed OGSR standard was applied to the hands and recovered in the way that is usual for IGSR collection, GSR stubs performed significantly better than swabs (~30 %) for the collection of OGSR. The optimised protocols were tested and compared for combined OGSR and inorganic GSR analysis using samples taken at a shooting range. The most suitable protocol for combined collection and analysis of IGSR and OGSR involved collection using GSR stubs followed by SEM-EDX analysis and liquid extraction using acetone followed by analysis with UHPLC.

However, to allow for the consecutive analysis of inorganic and organic GSR, specimens will often be stored for different lengths of time which may result in compounds of interest degrading. In order to optimise storage conditions, it is important to consider compound degradation on collection devices during storage. This study investigated the degradation over time of compounds potentially present in smokeless powders and OGSR on two collection devices, alcohol swabs and GSR stubs. Over a period of 63 days, the highest degree of degradation was found in the first four days. Interestingly, energetic compounds were generally found to be more stable than smokeless powder additives such as stabilisers including diphenylamine and ethyl centralite, which might be problematic considering that these compounds are common targets for OGSR. The findings can provide valuable information to operational forensic laboratories to optimise their storage durations.

The presence of both I/OGSR residues could potentially identify suspects in criminal investigations. Currently, two sampling devices are used to collect GSR: an aluminum stub with carbon adhesives to collect the IGSR particulates, and wipes to collect and test for OGSR. Field GSR detection tests are classified as presumptive, as the results are determined visually by color production. These tests are non-specific and are prone to false positives from environmental contaminants. Whereas, the main confirmatory GSR test is conducted via SEM-EDX which identifies morphology and lead-barium-antimony elemental composition generated from traditional primers. Sequential collection of I/OGSR residue can split the already miniscule sample, impacting downstream analytical techniques. An ideal presumptive OGSR color test would have increased specificity, would not interfere with the SEM-EDX analysis of IGSR, and allow for the analysis of the entire GSR sample on a single adhesive stub. The three organic color spot tests evaluated as candidates for this novel GSR detection protocol were nitrous acid, 4-nitrosophenol, and sodium borohydride. Each test was used to interrogate neat standards and mixtures in order to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each test, in addition to their application to real-world samples. As a result, the sodium borohydride test appeared to be the most specific and sensitive without hindering subsequent SEM-EDX analysis.

In most forensic laboratories, GSR analyses focus on the detection and characterisation of the inorganic components (IGSR), which are mainly particles containing mixtures of lead, barium and antimony originating from the primer. The increasing prevalence of heavy metal-free ammunition challenges the current protocols used for IGSR analysis. To provide complementary information to IGSR particles, the current study concentrated on the organic components (OGSR) arising from the combustion of the propellant. The study focused on four compounds well-known as being part of OGSR: ethylcentralite (EC), methylcentralite (MC), diphenylamine (DPA), N-nitrosodiphenylamine (N-nDPA). This study assessed the retention of these OGSR traces on a shooter's hands. The overall project aim was to provide appropriate information regarding OGSR persistence, which can be suitable to be integrated into the interpretation framework of OGSR as recommended by the recent ENFSI Guideline for Evaluative Reporting in Forensic Science. The persistence was studied through several intervals ranging from immediately after discharge to four hours and two ammunition calibres were chosen:.40 S&W calibre, used by the NSW Police Force; and.357 Magnum, which is frequently encountered in Australian casework. This study successfully detected the compounds of interest up to four hours after discharge. The trends displayed a large decrease in the amount detected during the first hour. A large variability was also observed due to numerous factors involved in the production, deposition and collection of OGSR.

A preliminary study was also performed to evaluate the prevalence of OGSR in the general population as well as in a police laboratory environment. In the transfer study, results indicated that OGSR are not only transferred to the hand of the shooter, but also to other parts of the upper body. Thus, wrists and forearms also represent interesting targets as they are washed less frequently than hands. Samples from the face and hair of the shooters resulted in no OGSR detection just after firing. It was also observed that the concentrations recovered from clothing are generally higher compared to the same skin area. Prevalence in both general (nÂ =Â 27) and police populations (nÂ =Â 25) was low. No OGSR was detected in the samples from the general population and only two samples from the police population were found positive.

There are 136 compounds considered to be associated with OGSR that have been highlighted in the literature. Many of these compounds could be classified as being ubiquitous in the environment and thus their detection as characteristic components of OGSR could cause issues with the interpretation of chemical ballistic evidence. The proposed system aims to address this problem by classifying OGSR compounds based on their forensic relevance with respect to the confirmation of GSR materials. To increase the forensic relevance of such a system, the large number of OGSR compounds reported in the literature has been decreased to 20 OGSR compounds based on the organic chemical composition of over 200 propellant powders.

Pairwise comparisons were restricted to samples having matching kernel shape, color, presence or absence of a perforation and measurements. Discrete results were analyzed for same and different products having matching chemical composition determined from a list of 13 organic components. A continuous score-based likelihood ratio was determined for same and different product comparisons using the Fisher transform of the Pearson correlation between the total ion spectra of the compared samples. Probability distributions for same product and different product comparisons appeared bimodal and were modeled with kernel density distributions. In the discrete and continuous data comparisons, the likelihood ratios for probabilities conditioned on same shape, color, presence/absence of perforation and size were found to provide relatively limited support for either the proposition of same product or different product. Further restricting the pairwise comparisons to samples belonging to the same cluster, as determined by agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, provided probability distributions for same product and different product comparisons that were more normal, but did not improve the resulting likelihood ratios.

These tests are often binary in that the data produced is interpreted as yes/no or present/absent. The utility of screening assays can be improved by evaluating a relevant background population and incorporating prior knowledge to refine the decision boundary. This paper describes the results of using ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and hand swab samples collected from 73 individuals to differentiate shooters from non-shooters by targeting organic constituents of firearms discharge residues. Each individual completed a questionnaire helpful in analyzing positive results when they did occur. Pattern matching was undertaken using neural networks, and decision thresholds were established using likelihood ratios derived from the population study. This approach significantly reduced the background positive rates compared to an arbitrary decision threshold technique. This methodology could be extended to other pattern-recognition algorithms used with instrumental data. This paper also reports the largest population study to date focused on the organic residues of firearms discharge.

Unburned powders were removed from various commercial ammunitions of different brand, primer composition, caliber, and age. The unburned powders and corresponding fired residues were analyzed by liquid chromatographyâ€“atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LCâ€“APCI-TOFMS). Multiplexed collision-induced dissociation was performed at increasing collision potentials resulting in successive fragmentation that provided structural information for compound identification in a non-targeted manner. Nine compounds were identified in the powders, including akardite II, ethyl centralite, diphenylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, and dibutyl phthalate. Multivariate statistical procedures were performed to first investigate association and discrimination of the unburned powders. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the chemical profiles suggested nine distinct groups of powders, according to the dominant organic compounds present. The clusters formed in hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were mostly in agreement with PCA groupings although HCA provided a metric to quantify the similarity. Finally, association of the fired residue to the corresponding unburned powder was possible although the success was highly dependent on the composition of the unburned powder and the extent of compound depletion as a result of firing.

Traditional forensic analysis has focused on inorganic particulates formed from the primer, referred to as gunshot residue (GSR). The last few years have seen interest in expanding the list of target compounds to include organic constituents of firearm discharge residue (OGSR). To facilitate adoption by the forensic community, new assays ideally should exploit instrumentation commonly found in forensic laboratories such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Here, a commercially available thermal separation probe that fits directly into the injection port was evaluated as a means of sample introduction for GC/MS operated in a selected ion monitoring mode. A statistical approach utilizing bivariate plots linked retention time to ion ratio data to afford a probabilistic interpretation of the results. A total of 27 authentic shooter swabs were collected after firing of 1â€“5 rounds and were analyzed in halves or triplicates. Ethyl centralite was detected in 81% of the samples; diphenylamine in 56%, and 2-nitrodiphenylamine in 14%. Dimethyl and dibutyl phthalates were detected in a majority of the swabs but also in many of the hand swab blanks. The use of surrogate standards provided a measure of recovery and reproducibility for retention times and ion ratios.

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) permitted the characterization, at the nanometer level (âˆ¼300 nm resolution), of the composition of particulates and organic compounds from skin swabs.

These distinctive compounds have long been analyzed by several instrumental techniques, many of which involve extensive sample preparation or have lengthy analysis times. Presented here is an ambient ionization method that requires no sample preparation, offers real-time analysis, and can be paired with a portable ion trap mass spectrometer for in-situ analysis. Swab touch spray ionization utilizes a rayon-tipped swab that has an aluminum wire handle which can simply be swabbed over the area of interest. After contacting the hands of the shooter, or other surfaces, the swab simply has solvent applied to the rayon tip and a high voltage applied to the aluminum handle. This process generates ions that the mass spectrometer will use to determine if the organic gunshot residues are present. Mass spectrometry allows for the direct confirmation of organic gunshot residue on suspects hands, confirmed through tandem mass spectrometry. Additional benefits of swab touch spray ionization are that the swabs are commercially available, they are sterile, and they are individually packaged to prevent contamination. The swabs are also forensically feasible because they are sealed prior to delivery by the vendor with a tamper-proof label. Here we have shown that this ambient ionization method allows for the direct swabbing of suspected shooters hands for trace residues and confirm the presence of the two organic gunshot residues investigated.

As the movement to self-manufacture firearms with 3D-printing grows, it is reasonable to assume that they will be increasingly used in crimes. Here, we test-fired gun barrels made with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), polyethylene terephthalate (PETG), chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), and nylon. The resulting cartridge cases, bullets, and gunshot residue (GSR) were examined by direct analysis in real time â€“ mass spectrometry (DART-MS). High-resolution mass spectra detected polymer from the gun barrel on bullets and cartridge casings for a 0.38 special caliber gun and, to a lesser extent, for a 0.22 caliber 3D-printed gun. Particles of plastic were identified in some GSR samples collected from clothing used as a backstop for test-fires. DART-MS also readily detected signature organic GSR compounds, including methyl centralite, ethyl centralite, diphenylamine, and nitrocellulose, on recovered bullets, cartridge cases, and in extracts of SEM stubs used to collect GSR from the clothing. Overall, this study demonstrates that analysis of firearm trace evidence using DART-MS deserves more attention, and that the technique may be particularly useful for investigating crimes involving 3D-printed guns.

In this study, thirty-four (34) smokeless powders were analyzed using GCâ€“MS and DART-TOFMS to determine how comparable the discriminatory power of each instrument was based on the smokeless powder constituents identified within each sample. Analysis of smokeless powders by DART-TOFMS generated comparable results to GCâ€“MS in a fraction of the time (âˆ¼30 seconds). Most peaks observed between the instruments were the same; however, N-nitroso-DPA was only observed in the DART-TOFMS spectra but was not a significant contributor. Samples were naturally grouped together using hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis, based on underlying features in the resulting spectra. Samples were placed into groupings based on significant peaks observed and relative intensities. Classification models were presented for both GCâ€“MS and DART-TOFMS and subsequently tested and compared. The classification models used in this study were linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest modeling. The groups observed were similar between the two instruments, indicating that DART-TOFMS provides comparable data to GCâ€“MS and could be used as a rapid screening technique.

Forensic science is one discipline in particular that has greatly benefited from the application of Raman spectroscopic research. Here, studies using Raman spectroscopy for analyzing criminalistic evidence, including body fluids, human tissue, bones, gunshot residue, fibers, and hair, are reviewed. Many of these methods demonstrate the significance of incorporating chemometrics for data analysis to provide more reliable and quantitative results with associated errors. Currently, there are only a few branches of forensic science that use Raman spectroscopy in practice, despite its wide range of advantages. However, many more applications have been developed in the research setting and are presented here. These studies showcase the versatility and dependability of Raman spectroscopy, specifically for criminalistic purposes. The advantages of developing and transitioning these techniques to be used in practice are also discussed, including the tremendous benefits of portable instrumentation. Raman spectroscopy can easily become an established analytical technique for many criminalistics disciplines because it allows for obtaining real-time, rapid, impartial, statistically confident results.

The rapid, highly-selective, and nondestructive method of Raman spectroscopy (RS) has shown continued promise for analysis of many types of forensic samples. The incorporation of chemometrics further enhances the specificity of RS, and offers the opportunity of automatic data analysis and estimation of error rates, which are important requirements for modern forensic tools. Applications of RS in forensic serology and for the analysis of gunshot residue (GSR) were chosen for this review since RS promises significant advancement of these areas for practical forensics. The studies included here, particularly with the utilization of portable instrumentation, support how crucial RS is to the field of forensic science, and should help facilitate its incorporation for routine sample analysis in the near future.

This initial study achieved proof of concept for this approach. Here, we report validation studies which investigate the reproducibility/ruggedness and specificity of the approach. Raman mapping for GSR detection on adhesive tape was performed on an independent Raman microscope, not used to generate the training set. These independent spectra were classified against the original training dataset using support vector machine discriminant analysis (SVM-DA). The resulting classification rates of 100% illustrate the reproducibility of the technique, its independence upon a specific instrument and provide an external validation for the approach. Additionally, the same procedure for GSR collection (tape lifting) was performed to collect samples from environmental sources, which could potentially provide false-positive assignments for current GSR analysis techniques. Thus, particles associated with automotive mechanics were collected. Automotive brake and tire materials are often composed of the heavy metals lead, barium, and antimony, which are the key elements targeted by current GSR detection technique. It was determined that Raman spectroscopic analysis was not susceptible to misclassifications from these samples. Results from these validation experiments illustrate the great potential of Raman microspectroscopic mapping used with tape lifting as a viable complimentary tool to current methodologies for GSR detection. Furthermore, current methodologies are not well-developed for automated organic GSR detection. Illustrated here, Raman microscoptrosocpic mapping has the potential for the automatic identification of organic GSR.

The macroscopic GSR particles are basically formed by burned and non-burned gunpowder. Motivated by the demand of trace analysis of these samples, in this paper, the use of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was evaluated for the analysis of gunpowders and macroscopic GSR particles. Twenty-one different smokeless gunpowders were extracted with ethanol. SERS spectra were obtained from the diluted extracts using gold nanoaggregates and an excitation wavelength of 633Â nm. They show mainly bands that could be assigned to the stabilizers diphenylamine and ethylcentralite present in the gunpowders. Then, macroscopic GSR particles obtained after firing two different ammunition cartridges on clothing were also measured using the same procedure. SERS allowed the detection of the particles collected with an aluminum stub from cloth targets without interferences from the adhesive carbon. The results demonstrate the great potential of SERS for the analysis of macroscopic GSR particles. Furthermore, they indicate that the grain-to-grain inhomogeneity of the gunpowders needs to be considered.

It presents a non-destructive, non-toxic, highly visual and hiperspectral-based approach. The method was based on classical least squares regression, and was tested with the ammunition propellants and their standard componentsâ€™ spectra. The propellantsâ€™ spectra were satisfactorily used (R2 &gt;0.966, and CorrCoef &gt;0.982) for identifying the GSR irrespective of the type of ammunition used for the shooting. In a more versatile approach, nitrocellulose, the main component in the ammunition propellants, resulted an excellent standard for identifying GSR patterns (R2&gt;0.842, and CorrCoef &gt;0.908). In this case, the propellantsâ€™ stabilizers (diphenilamine and centralite), and its nitrated derivatives as well as dinitrotoluene, showed also high spectral activity. Therefore, they could be recommended as complementary standards for confirming the GSR identification. These findings establish the proof of concept for a science-based evidence useful to support expert reports and final court rulings. This approach for obtaining GSR patterns can be an excellent alternative to the current and traditional chemical methods, which are based in presumptive and invasive colour tests.

Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the use of violet-blue wavelengths (430, 450 and 470 nm) provided the largest contrast between the GSR particles and the white cotton fabric. Then, the correlation between the amount of GSR particles on clothing targets and the shooting distance was studied. By selecting the blue frame of multispectral images (i.e. the blue frame in the red-green-blue (RGB) system which falls at 470 nm), the amount of pixels containing GSR particles was accounted based on the intensity of pixels in that frame. Results demonstrated that the number of pixels containing GSR exponentially decreases with the shooting distance from 30 to 220 cm following a particular exponential equation. However, the targets shot at the shortest distance (10 cm) did not satisfy the above equation, probably due to the noticeable differences of the GSR-pattern of these targets (e.g. high presence of soot). Then, the equation was applied to validation samples to estimate the shooting distances, obtaining results with an error below 10%.

A series of ammunition (different brands and different manufacturers) was analyzed concerning the luminescence of their propellant. Shooting target samples with different shooting distances were produced on standard textile tissue and analyzed with this optical infrared inspection. The number of luminescent GSR particles per area was measured and curves with particle density vs. shooting distance were drawn. The method was applied on three ammunition types with different particle morphology shot with a pistol and one ammunition type shot with a revolver. The shooting series performed with the revolver showed a large particle density variation within the samples of identical shooting distances. In this case, the ratio of the amount of particles within the area around the bullet hole and within a ring with a defined distance from the bullet hole was calculated. These data resulted in measures with much lower standard deviations, which is a prove that the distribution pattern depends on the shooting distance and not on the amount of GSR particles.

Unburned propellant powder particles in the gunshot residue (GSR) on the textile of each sample were transferred onto TLC-plates with the aid of an organic solvent. The patterns of the partially and the all-luminescent propellant powder residue on the TLC-plates were visualized in the near infrared wavelength range by the aid of an IR-sensitive camera. The transfer TLC-plates of all six ammunition types were sprayed with a diphenylamine solution, which reacts with the nitrate groups of the nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine and produces deep blue dots thereof. A series of samples with different shooting distances produced with one of the ammunition types was used for the shooting distance determination study. Transfer on TLC-plates was performed and pictures of the plates were taken before and after the chemical reaction. An imaging software was used to measure the density of the particles on the transfer TLC-plate pictures within a defined area around the bullet hole. Curves were drawn with the particle density data vs. the shooting distance. It has been shown, that the transfer of the particles onto a TLC-plate and the chemical reaction eliminate the limitations of the IR-method presented in Part I. Therefore, this method allows shooting distance determination at any textile and for any ammunition type as soon as unburned propellant powder particles are left on the target tissue.

Different mechanisms of fiber rupture as a function of fiber type and shooting distance were detected, namely fusing, melting, scorching, and mechanical breakage. To estimate the firing distance, the approximately exponential decay of GSR coverage as a function of radial distance from the entrance hole was determined from image analysis, instead of relying on chemical analysis with EDX, which is problematic in the VP-SEM. A set of backscattered electron images, with sufficient magnification to discriminate micrometer wide GSR particles, was acquired at different radial distances from the entrance hole. The atomic number contrast between the GSR particles and the organic fibers allowed to find a robust procedure to segment the micrographs into binary images, in which the white pixel count was attributed to GSR coverage. The decrease of the white pixel count followed an exponential decay, and it was found that the reciprocal of the decay constant, obtained from the least-square fitting of the coverage data, showed a linear dependence on the shooting distance.

This proficiency test was developed out of collaborative studies which were previously carried out by a number of pre-selected ENFSI laboratories. The aim of this test was to assess the laboratoriesâ€™ performance in visualizing the lead patterns on a shot object, and compare the questioned patterns with provided test shot patterns. The participating laboratories were requested to estimate the presumed shooting distance following their individual laboratory specific methods (SOPs) for shooting distance/muzzle-to-target determination. The submitted results were compiled by means of z scores according to the IUPAC and EURACHEM guidelines, and an extended statistical evaluation was performed. This is one of the first proficiency tests in the field of qualitative forensic methods where z scores were successfully utilized. This paper summarizes the results of the study and presents the overall performance of the participating laboratories.

The victim's body with double gunshot wounding in his forehead, a machine gun in the sustained fire mode with a silencer, and four cartridge cases were found. Examinations of the evidence, the case file studies, and experiments dedicated to the case were carried out. Relationships between the placement of cartridge cases and the gun were established using a fast camera. The distributions of gunshot residues on the evidence materials and within the comparative gunshot patterns were studied by means of optical and electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis, and infrared spectroscopy. The shooting distance was assessed to be 30 cm or more, whereas the greatest distance that could have been achieved by the victim himself was about 11â€“13 cm.

The studies were inspired by recent shooting cases with the use of a firearm with a silencer and the need to estimate the shooting distance to human body naked and covered with clothing. A series of experiments were performed in the shooting range using a machine pistol and the appropriate ammunition cal. 7.65Â mm Browning. Targets were placed in the range of 0â€“30Â cm from the gun and covered either with white cotton fabric or a porcine skin that mocked people's clothing and the naked skin. Both the organic and inorganic residue were examined by means of optical microscopy, infrared spectrometry as well as scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. The influence of factors, such as sound suppressor, shooting distance and the substrate type on the mechanism of particles spread and their availability for research was established and discussed.

This study aimed to determine the deposition patterns of GSR once a bullet passed through an initial target and continued on its path into additional targets. Multiple repetitions were performed to assess the GSR deposition patterns after a bullet was shot through a closed window into either a dummy or a wall within an enclosed room. Samples were taken from both the primary and secondary target holes as well as from nontarget areas. Significant amounts of GSR were found on all samples. The results show that GSR continues to be deposited along the path of the bullet after passing through a primary glass target. These findings reiterate the lack of probative value in collecting GSR samples from gunshot victims even if they are in an enclosed area separate from the shooter.

This method is based on SPME (Solid Phase Micro- Extraction) sampling from the atmosphere inside the shotgun barrel. Two analytical systems were used in parallel, the GC/TEA and GC/FID(MS) system. These two systems detect various combustion products and the estimation of time since the latest discharge is based on the rate of escape of the volatile discharge residues from the barrel as a function of time. If the ammunition used in the suspect firearm is known, the use of decay curves for the actual firearm and the actual ammunition is fairly straightforward. For unknown ammunition, repetitive samplings must be performed and the results fitted to decay curves obtained for other ammunition types according to the proposed procedure. Generally, the method presented in this study can give an indication whether a weapon was fired, e.g., 2 to 3 days, 1 to 2 weeks, or more than 3 weeks ago. Some factors that may impact data interpretation were studied, such as the effect of cleaning the barrel, the number of shots fired, the eventual disturbance to the system by SPME sampling and the effect of temperature of the storage.",Firearm discharge residues; Firearms; Forensic science; Gas chromatography (GC); GC-TEA; SPME; Time since discharge,article; ballistics; combustion; curve fitting; gas chromatography; gunshot injury; mass spectrometry; priority journal; solid phase extraction; storage; temperature; time; weapon,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031702710,,IFSMS 2019,Gunshot Residue,Gunshot Residue

To reach this aim, it was previously proposed that the decrease of volatile organic compounds released during discharge is monitored over time using non-destructive headspace extraction techniques. While promising results were obtained for large-calibre cartridges (e.g., shotgun shells), handgun calibres yielded unsatisfying results. In addition to the natural complexity of the specimen itself, these can also be attributed to some selective choices in the methods development. Thus, the present series of paper aimed to more systematically evaluate the potential of headspace analysis to estimate the time since discharge of cartridges through the use of more comprehensive analytical and interpretative techniques. Specifically, in this first part, a method based on headspace sorptive extraction (HSSE) was comprehensively optimised and validated, as the latter recently proved to be a more efficient alternative than previous approaches. For this purpose, 29 volatile organic compounds were preliminary selected on the basis of previous works. A multivariate statistical approach based on design of experiments (DOE) was used to optimise variables potentially involved in interaction effects. Introduction of deuterated analogues in sampling vials was also investigated as strategy to account for analytical variations. Analysis was carried out by selected ion mode, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GCâ€“MS). Results showed good chromatographic resolution as well as detection limits and peak area repeatability. Application to 9Â mm spent cartridges confirmed that the use of co-extracted internal standards allowed for improved reproducibility of the measured signals. The validated method will be applied in the second part of this work to estimate the time since discharge of 9Â mm spent cartridges using multivariate models.

Several multivariate regression and pre-treatment methods were tested and compared to univariate models based on non-linear regression. Random forests (RF) and partial least squares (PLS) proceeded by pairwise log-ratios normalisation (PLR) showed the best results, and allowed to estimate time since discharge up to 48Â h of ageing and to differentiate recently fired from older cartridges (e.g., less than 5Â h compared to more than 1â€“2 days). The proposed multivariate approaches showed significant improvement compared to univariate models. The effects of storage conditions were also tested and results demonstrated that temperature, humidity and cartridge position should be taken into account when estimating the time since discharge.
