# International Forensic Science Managers Symposium References Analysis Tool 

# The use of forensic evidence has become indispensable in many countries and jurisdiction around the world, however the dissemination of research advancements does not necessarily directly or easily reach the forensic science community.

# The R-Shiny pp provides an analysis of references lists available in the INTERPOL reports with an export functionality of searched records. 

# Using the R-Shiny code

# This code was developed using Rstudio 1.4.1106 and R 4.0.4

# To get started, open this file in RStudio as part of a new project, this is to ensure the working directory is set correctly.

# The app.R is the code running the R-Shiny app.

# Import files can be changed using the files format already provided. The imported data is csv and for speed is entirely contained in the All_Data_Shiny.csv (all corrections observed in the standalone version already applied)
